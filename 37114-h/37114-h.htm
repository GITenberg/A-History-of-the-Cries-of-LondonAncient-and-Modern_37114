<p class="note">&#8220;We frequently meet with the pieman in old prints; and, in Hogarth&#8217;s
&#8216;March to Finchley,&#8217; there he stands in the very centre of the crowd,
grinning with delight at the adroitness of one robbery, while he is
himself the victim of another. We learn from this admirable figure by the
greatest painter of English life, that the pieman of the last century
perambulated the streets in professional costume; and we gather further,
from the burly dimensions of his wares, that he kept his trade alive by
the laudable practice of giving &#8216;a good pennyworth for a penny.&#8217; Justice
compels us to observe that his successors of a later generation have not
been very conscientious observers of this maxim.&#8221;</p>

<p>The idea of printing and publishing &#8220;A History of the Cries of
London&mdash;Ancient and Modern,&#8221; somewhat in the manner and style here
presented to the public, was first suggested to me by the late Rev:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img008.jpg" alt="Thomas Hugo" /></div>

<p>Author of &#8220;The Bewick Collector,&#8221; 1866. The Supplement to same, 1868, and
&#8220;Bewick&#8217;s Woodcuts,&#8221; 1870, etc., and at the time, Rector of West Hackney
Church, Stoke Newington, London, N., in the year 1876.</p>


<p>While actively engaged in preparing for publication &#8220;The Life and Times of</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img007.jpg" alt="James Catnach" /></div>

<p>late of Seven Dials: Ballad Monger,&#8221;&mdash;to which the present work may be
considered a sequel, and the completion of the series on the subject of
the&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><strong>&#8220;CURIOSITIES OF STREET LITERATURE,&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>I had frequently to consult the pages of &#8220;The Bewick Collector,&#8221; and other
works of a kindred character for information respecting the elder Catnach,
who, by himself, and afterwards in conjunction with his partner, and
subsequently his successor, William Davison, employed Thomas Bewick, the
famous English artist who imparted the first impulse to the art of wood
engraving, for several of their Alnwick publications. This led to my
communicating with the Rev. Thomas Hugo, wherein I informed him of my
plans, and of the object I had in view with regard to the publication I
was then preparing for the press: at the same time soliciting his
co-operation, especially in reference to the loan of some of the Bewick
wood-cuts, formerly possessed by the elder Catnach, while he was in
business as a printer, in Narrowgate Street, Alnwick, an ancient borough
and market-town in Northumberland.</p>

<p>In answer to my application, I received the letters that follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>The proposed interview took place at the Rectory-house, on the 10th of
November, and was of a very delightful and intellectual character. The
reverend gentleman found me an apt scholar in all matters with respect to
his favourite &#8220;Hobby-horse,&#8221; viz:&mdash;the Brothers Bewick and their Works.
All the rich and rare Bewickian gems were placed before me for inspection,
and all the desired assistance I needed at his hands was freely offered
and ultimately carried out. During our conversation the learned Rector
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;I look upon it as a curious fact that you should have been of late
occupying your leisure in working out your own ideas of Catnach and
his Times, because, while I was in the office at Monmouth-court, where
I went several times to look out all the examples of Bewick I could
find, and which I afterwards purchased of Mr. Fortey&mdash;the person who
has succeeded to the business of the late James Catnach, I one day
caught nearly the same notion, but it was more in reference to <span class="smcap">Old
London Cries</span>: as I possess a fairly large collection of nicely
engraved wood-blocks on the subject, that I met with in &#8216;Canny
Newcassel,&#8217;&mdash;in some of which it is asserted, and can hardly be
denied, that Thomas Bewick had a hand. I have since used the set in my
&#8216;<span class="smcap">Bewick&#8217;s Woodcuts</span>.&#8217; But, alas!&mdash;<i>Tempus fugit</i>, and all thoughts on
the subject got&mdash;by reason of my having so much to do and think
of&mdash;crowded out of my memory. Now, sir, as you seem to have much more
leisure time than myself, I shall be happy to turn the subject-matter
over to you and to assist in every way in my power.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>I thanked the rev. gentleman, at the same time promising to bear the
suggestion in mind for a future day.</p>

<p>Accept my best thanks for your letter, books, and promises of future
gifts, all of which I cordially accept.</p>

Around us all a solemn silence stealing,<br />

Yes, he was there, our good and earnest Rector,<br />

Giving the cup, he, the pure Faith&#8217;s protector&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That cup of blessing with a trembling hand.</span><br />
<br />
His church, for which he felt such admiration,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was deck&#8217;d with flow&#8217;rs and evergreens that morn,</span><br />
In praise to Christ, who died for our salvation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deign&#8217;d as a weak infant to be born.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! little did we think that happy morning&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So truly, bravely kept he at his post&mdash;</span><br />
When next a Sabbath came, to us his warning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kind, yet noble, presence would be lost.</span><br />
<br />
That solemn sound, which tells of souls departed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Took the glad place of that which calls to prayer,</span><br />
And his loved people, shocked and broken-hearted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could hardly enter, for <i>he</i> was not there.</span><br />
<br />
But when they heard it was his last desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they should meet at midnight as was said,</span><br />
They met by thousands, mov&#8217;d with holy fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spoke in whispers of their shepherd&mdash;<i>dead</i>.</span><br />
<br />
No, no, not dead, but calm in Jesus sleeping;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free from all sorrow, all reproach, all pain:</span><br />
And though he leaves a congregration weeping<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their earthly loss is his eternal gain.</span><br />
<br />
He loved the weak, and all the mute creation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In generous deeds he ever took his part;</span><br />
At Death, the <i>thrice</i>-repeated word <i>Salvation</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Showed the firm trust of that true, tender heart.</span><br />

here state that I have drawn largely from Charles Knight&#8217;s &#8220;London.&#8221;

greatly enriched the contents of this volume, I beg to express my best
thanks. I must in a more particular manner mention the names of&mdash;the one

Most of the cuts were drawn by Robert Johnson and John Bewick, and all
were engraved by Thomas Bewick, except the vignettes on the title-pages,
and the large cut of &#8220;The Sad Historian,&#8221; and the tail-piece at the end of
the volume, which was done by John Bewick.</p>

<p class="note">The most magnificent result of the efforts of the wood-engraver,
type-founder, paper-maker, and printer, &#8220;that ever was produced in any
age, or in any country.&#8221; Bulmer realized, after paying all expenses, a
profit of &pound;1,500 on the work these exquisite blocks adorned.</p>

<p class="note">This work contains the best specimens of John Bewick&#8217;s abilities as a
designer; all the cuts were drawn by him except one, but none of them were
engraved by him. Shortly after he had finished the drawings on the blocks,
he left London and returned to the North in consequence of ill-health.
They were engraved by Thomas Bewick, with the exception of the tail-piece
at the end of the volume, which was engraved by Charles Nesbit, one of his
pupils.</p>

<p class="center">SOMERVILE&#8217;S CHASE.</p>

<p class="note">The cuts in the Chase, on the whole, are superior in point of execution to
those in the Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell. Many conceive it impossible
that such delicate effects could be produced from blocks of wood, and his
late Majesty (George III.) ordered his bookseller, Mr. George Nicolls, to
procure the blocks for his inspection, that he might convince himself of
the fact.</p>

<p class="note">Speaking of the death of John Bewick, which took place at Ovingham on the
5th of December, 1795,&mdash;aged 35, a writer in the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i>
says, &#8220;The works of this young artist will be held in estimation, and the
engravings to &#8216;Somervile&#8217;s Chase&#8217; will be a monument of fame of more
celebrity than marble can bestow.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><i>SECOND STATE!!</i></p>

<p>Among the very many and all much admired Tail-pieces drawn and engraved by
Bewick himself, the above, which, in its&mdash;<i>First state!</i> is at page 285 of
vol. i. of &#8216;A History of British Birds,&#8217; 1797, has obtained by far the
greatest notoriety. It appears that soon after publication, it was pointed
out to Bewick that the nakedness of a prominent part of his subject
required to be a little more covered&mdash;<i>draped</i>! So one of his apprentices
was employed to blacken over with ink all the copies then remaining
unsold. But by the time Bewick received the &#8216;gentle hint,&#8217; a goodly number
had been delivered to local subscribers and the London agents&mdash;Messrs. G.
G. and J. Robinson. It is these &#8216;<i>not inked!</i>&#8217; copies that are now so
readily sought after by all &#8220;Bewick Collectors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img022.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><i>THIRD STATE!!!</i></p>

<p>For the next, and all subsequent editions a plug was inserted in the
block, and the representation of two bars of wood engraved upon it, to
hide the <i>part</i>! However, it seems that before the block was thus altered
and amended, many impressions on various papers were taken of the&mdash;<i>First
state!</i> The late Rev. Hugo possessed several of such, one of which&mdash;<i>Proof
on paper</i>&mdash;he gave me on the 10th of November, 1876.&mdash;C. H.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="caps">The cries of London</span> have ever been very popular, whether as broadsides,
books, ballads, or engravings. Artists of all countries and times have
delighted to represent those peculiarities of costume and character which
belong to the history of street-cries, and the criers thereof. Annibale
Carracci&mdash;1560-1609&mdash;has immortalized the cries of Bologna; and from the
time of Elizabeth to that of Queen Victoria, authors, artists and printers
combined, have presented the Cries and Itinerant Trades of London, in
almost numberless forms, and in various degrees of quality, from the
roughest and rudest wood-cut-blocks to the finest of copper and steel
plate engravings, or skilfully wrought etchings. While many of the early
English dramatists often introduced the subject, eminent composers were
wont to &#8220;set to music&#8221; as catch, glee, or roundelaye, all the London Cries
then most in vogue,&mdash;&#8220;They were, I ween, ryght merrye songs, and the
musick well engraved.&#8221;</p>

<p>The earliest mention of London trade-cries is by Dan John Lydgate
(1370-1450), a Monk of the Benedictine Abbey of Bury St. Edmund&#8217;s, the
friend and immediate follower of Geoffrey Chaucer, and one of the most
prolific writers of his age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> this country has produced. To enumerate
Lydgate&#8217;s pieces would be to write out the catalogue of a small library.
No poet seems to have possessed a greater versatility of talents. He moves
with equal ease in every mode of composition; and among his minor pieces
he has left us a very curious poem entitled &#8220;London Lyckpeny,&#8221; <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>London Lackpenny</i>: this has been frequently printed; by Strutt, Pugh,
Nicolas, and partly by John Stow in &#8220;A Survey of London,&#8221; 1598. There are
two copies in the British Museum, Harl. MSS., 367 and 542. We somewhat
modernize the text of the former and best of these copies, which differ
considerably from each other.</p>

<p>In &#8220;London Lackpenny&#8221; we have a most interesting and graphic picture of
the hero coming to Westminster, in term time, to obtain legal redress for
the wrong he had sustained, and explain to a man of law his case&mdash;&#8220;<i>How my
goods were defrauded me by falsehood</i>,&#8221; but being without the means to pay
even the preliminary fee, he was sent&mdash;&#8220;from pillar to post,&#8221; that is from
one Law-court to another, but although he &#8220;<i>crouched, kneeled, prayed for
God&#8217;s sake, and Mary&#8217;s love</i>, he could not get from one the&mdash;<i>mum of his
mouth</i>.&#8221; So leaving the City of Westminster&mdash;minus his hood, he walked on
to the City of London, which he tells us was crowded with peripatetic
traders, but tempting as all their goods and offers were, his
<i>lack-of-money</i> prevented him from indulging in any of them&mdash;But, however,
let <i>Lackpenny</i>, through the ballad, speak for himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>Spectacles to read before printing was invented must have had a rather
limited market; but we must bear in mind where they were sold. In
Westminster Hall there were lawyers and rich suitors
congregated,&mdash;worshipful men, who had a written law to study and expound,
and learned treatises diligently to peruse, and titles to hunt after
through the labyrinths of fine and recovery. The dealer in spectacles was
a dealer in hats, as we see; and the articles were no doubt both of
foreign manufacture. But lawyers and suitors had also to feed, as well as
to read with spectacles; and on the Thames side, instead of the
coffee-houses of modern date, were tables in the open air, where men every
day ate of &#8220;<i>bread, ribs of beef, both fat and full fine</i>,&#8221; and drank
jollily of &#8220;<i>ale and wine</i>,&#8221; as they do now at a horse-race:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Chepe (Cheapside) he saw &#8220;<i>much people</i>&#8221; standing, who proclaimed the
merits of their &#8220;<i>velvets, silk, lawn, and Paris thread</i>.&#8221; These, however,
were shopkeepers; but their shops were not after the modern fashion of
plate-glass windows, and carpeted floors, and lustres blazing at night
with a splendour that would put to shame the glories of an eastern palace.
They were rude booths, the owners of which bawled as loudly as the
itinerants; and they went on bawling for several centuries, like butchers
in a market, so that, in 1628, Alexander Gell, a bachelor of divinity, was
sentenced to lose his ears and to be degraded from the ministry, for
giving his opinion of Charles I.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> that he was fitter to stand in a
Cheapside shop with an apron before him, and say &#8220;What do ye lack, what do

<p>The London Stone, the <i>lapis milliaris</i> (mile stone) of the Romans, has
never failed to arrest the attention of the &#8220;Countryman in Lunnun.&#8221; The
Canwyke Street of the days of John Lydgate, is the Cannon Street of the
present. &#8220;<i>Hot sheep&#8217;s feet</i>,&#8221; which were cried in the streets in the time
of Henry V., are now sold <i>cold</i> as &#8220;sheep&#8217;s trotters,&#8221; and vended at the
doors of the lower-priced theatres, music-halls, and public-houses. Henry
Mayhew in his &#8220;London Labour and the London Poor,&#8221; estimates that there
are sold weekly 20,000 sets, or 80,000 feet. The wholesale price at the
&#8220;trotter yard&#8221; is five a penny, which gives an outlay by the street
sellers of &pound;3,033 6s. 8d. yearly. The cry which is still heard and
tolerated by law, that of <i>Mackerel</i> rang through every street. The cry of
<i>Rushes-green</i> tells us of by-gone customs. In ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> long before the
luxury of carpets was known in England, the floors of houses were covered
with rushes. The strewing of rushes in the way where processions were to
pass is attributed by our poets to all times and countries. Thus at the
coronation of Henry V., when the procession is coming, the grooms cry&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Not worth a rush</i> became a common comparison for anything worthless; the
rush being of so little value as to be trodden under foot. <i>Rush-lights</i>,

<p>Eastcheap, this ancient thoroughfare, originally extended from
Tower-street westward to the south end of Clement&#8217;s-lane, where
Cannon-street begins. It was the Eastern Cheap or Market, as distinguished
from Westcheap, now Cheapside. The site of the Boar&#8217;s Head Tavern, first
mentioned <i>temp.</i> Richard II., the scene of the revels of Falstaff and
Henry V., when Prince of Wales, is very nearly that of the statue of King
William IV. <i>Lackpenny</i> had presented to him several of the real Signs of
the Times and of Life in London with &#8220;<i>ribs of beef</i>&mdash;<i>many a

<p>The manners and customs of the dwellers in Cornhill in the time of John
Lydgate, when a stranger could have his hood stolen at one end of the town
and see it exposed for sale at the other, forcibly reminds us of
Field-lane and the Jew Fagin, so faithfully sketched in pen and ink by
Charles Dickens of our day. Where &#8220;a young man from the country&#8221; would run
the risk of meeting with an Artful Dodger, to pick his pocket of his silk
handkerchief at the entrance of the Lane, and it would be offered him for
sale by a Jew fence at the end, not only &#8220;Once a Week&#8221; but &#8220;All the Year
Round.&#8221; However, when Charles Dickens and Oliver Twist came in, Field-lane
and Fagin went out.</p>

a taverner, who with a cringing bow, and taking him by the

<i>Lackpenny</i>, coming to the safe conclusion that &#8220;<i>a penny can do no more

<p>With unpaved streets, and no noise of coaches to drown any particular
sound, we may readily imagine the din of the great London thoroughfares of
four centuries ago, produced by all the vociferous demand for custom. The
chief body of London retailers were then itinerant,&mdash;literally pedlars;
and those who had attained some higher station were simply stall-keepers.
The streets of trade must have borne a wonderful resemblance to a modern
fair. Competition was then a very rude thing, and the loudest voice did
something perhaps to carry the customer.</p>

with their beetles and wedges on their backs, crying &#8220;<i>Have you any wood

<p>The London of Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and Co.,&mdash;<i>Limited</i> as it was within
its great wall, occupied very much the same space as that now covered by
the City proper; its streets were narrow and winding, yet there were still
left many open spaces; it was covered with people; its river was full of
shipping; it was rich, prosperous, and possessed of a considerable amount
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> liberty. The great wall of London, broad and strong, with towers at
intervals, was more than two miles long, from end to end, beginning at the
Tower of London on the east, and ending at the Fleet River and the Thames
on the west.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img049.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">ALDERSGATE.</p>

<p>As regards the gates, there were anciently only four&mdash;namely, Aldersgate,
Aldgate, Ludgate, and Bridgegate&mdash;that is to say, one for each of the
cardinal points. Then other gates and posterns were added for the
convenience of the citizens: Bishopsgate, for those who had business in
the direction of Norfolk, Suffolk, or Cambridgeshire; Moorgate, for those
who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> would practice archery, or take their recreation in Moor Fields;
Cripplegate, more ancient than the two preceding, had a prison for debtors
attached to it; and there was also a postern for the Convent of Grey
Friars, now Christ&#8217;s Hospital. At Newgate was a small, incommodious, and
fever-haunted prison for criminals; and at Ludgate was another prison,
appropriated to debtors, trespassers, and those who committed contempt of
Court. Along the river-side were several water-gates, the chief of which
were Blackfriars, Greenhithe, Dowgate and Billingsgate.</p>

<p>Within the narrow space of the City Walls there rose a forest of towers
and spires. The piety of Merchants had erected no fewer than a hundred and
three churches, which successive citizens were continually rebuilding,
beautifying, or enlarging. They were filled with the effigies and splendid
tombs, the painted and gilded arms, of their founders and benefactors, for
whose souls masses were continually said.</p>

<p class="center">CHEAPSIDE CROSS.</p>

<p>&#8220;London was divided into Wards, and was perhaps as catholic in its
commercial and industrial pursuits then as now. Every kind of trade was
carried on within its walls, just as every kind of merchandise was sold.
The combination of fellows of the same craft began in very early times,
guilds were formed for the protection of trade and its followers; the
guild-brothers met once a month to consider the interests of the craft,
regulating prices, recovering debts and so forth. But the London of the
period was not so gay as Paris, nor so bustling and prosperous as Antwerp,
nor so full of splendour and intellectual life as Venice.<a name='fna_1' id='fna_1' href='#f_1'><small>[1]</small></a> Yet to the
Englishman of the day it was an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ever-lasting wonder. Its towers and
palaces, its episcopal residences and gentlemen&#8217;s inns, the bustle of its
commerce, the number of its foreigners, the wealth of its Companies, and
the bravery of its pageants, invested it with more poetry than can be
claimed for it at the present time, unless Wealth be our deity, Hurry our
companion, and Progress our muse. The rich were leaving their pleasant
country mansions to plunge into its delights. At the law terms there was a
regular influx of visitors, who seemed to think more of taking tobacco
than of winning a lawsuit. Ambitious courtiers, hopeful ecclesiastics,
pushing merchants, and poetic dreamers, were all caught by the
fascinations of London. Site, antiquity, life, and, above all, abundance
of the good things that make up half its charm, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> the shape of early
delicacies, costly meats, and choice wines, combined to make it a
miraculous city in the eyes of the Elizabethan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The external appearance of the City was certainly picturesque. Old grey
walls threw round it the arm of military protection. Their gates were
conspicuous objects, and the white uniforms of the train-bands on guard,
with their red crosses on the back, fully represented the valour which
wraps itself in the British flag and dies in its defence. To the north
were the various fields whose names survive, diversified by an occasional
house, and Dutch-looking windmills, creaking in the breeze. Finsbury was a
fenny tract, where the City archers practised; Spitalfields, an open,
grassy place, with grounds for artillery exercise and a market cross; and
Smithfield, or Smoothfield, was an unenclosed plain, where tournaments
were held, horses were sold, and martyrs had been burnt. To the east was
the Tower of London, black with age, armed with cannon and culverin, and
representing the munificence which entertained royalty as well as the
power which punished traitors. Beyond it was Wapping, the Port of London,
with its narrow streets, its rope-walks and biscuit shops. Black fronted
taverns, with low doorways and leaden framed windows, their rooms reeking

with smoke and noisy with the chatter of ear-ringed sailors, were to be
found in nearly every street. Here the merchant adventurer came to hire
his seamen, and here the pamphleteer or the ballad-maker could any night
gather materials for many a long-winded yarn about Drake and the Spanish
main, negroes, pearls, and palm-groves.</p>

<p class="center">OLD STAGE WAGGON.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the west, the scene was broken with hamlets, trees, and country roads.
Marylebone and Hyde Park were a royal hunting-ground, with a manor house,
where the Earls of Oxford lived in later times. Piccadilly was &#8216;the road
to Reading,&#8217; with foxgloves growing in its ditches, gathered by the
simple dealers of Bucklersbury, to make anodynes for the weary-hearted.
Chelsea was a village; Pimlico a country hamlet, where pudding-pies were
eaten by strolling Londoners on a Sunday. Westminster was a city standing
by itself, with its Royal Palace, its Great Hall for banquets and the
trial of traitors, its sanctuary, its beautiful Abbey, and its famous
Almonry. St. James&#8217;s Park was walled with red brick, and contained the
palace Henry VIII. had built for Anne Boleyn. Whitehall Palace was in its
glory. The Strand, along which gay ladies drove in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> &#8216;crab-shell
coaches,&#8217; had been recently paved, and its streams of water diverted. A
few houses had made their appearance on the north side of the Strand,
between the timber house and its narrow gateway, which then formed Temple
Bar, the boundary between London and Westminster, and the church of St.
Mary-le-Strand. The southern side was adorned with noble episcopal
residences, and with handsome turreted mansions, extending to the river,
rich with trees and gardens, and relieved by flashes of sparkling water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>&#8220;To the south, Lambeth, with its palace and church, and Faux Hall, were
conspicuous objects. Here were pretty gardens and rustic cottages. The
village of Southwark, with its prisons, its public theatres, its palace,
and its old Tabard Inn, had many charms. It was the abode of Shakespeare
himself, as he resided in a good house in the Liberty of the Clink, and
was assessed in the weekly payment of 6d., no one but Henslowe, Alleyn,
Collins, and Barrett, being so highly rated. That part of the Borough of
Southwark known as Bankside was not only famous in Shakespeare&#8217;s time for
its Theatres, but also as the acknowledged retreat of the warmest of the
<i>demi-monde</i>!</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not forget the river Thames. It was one of the sights of the
time. Its waters were pure and bright, full of delicate salmon, and
flecked by snowy swans, &#8216;white as Lemster wool.&#8217; Wherries plied freely on
its surface. Tall masts clustered by its banks. Silken-covered tiltboats,
freighted with ruffed and feathered ladies and gentlemen, swept by, the
watermen every now and then breaking the plash of the waves against their
boats by singing out, in their bass voices, &#8216;Heave and how, rumbelow.&#8217; At
night, the scene reminded the travelled man of Venice. All the mansions by
the water-side had river-terraces and steps, and each one its own
tiltboat, barge, and watermen. Down these steps, lighted by torches and
lanterns, stepped dainty ladies, in their coloured shoes, with masks on
their faces, and gay gallants, in laced cloaks, by their side, bound for
Richmond or Westminster, to mask and revel. Noisy parties of wits and
Paul&#8217;s men crossed to Bankside to see <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, or <i>Hamlet the
Dane</i>, or else &#8216;The most excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> historie of the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>,

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img054.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">BAYNARD&#8217;S CASTLE.</p>

<p>&#8220;From Westminster to London Bridge was a favourite trip. There was plenty
to see. The fine Strand-side houses were always pointed
out&mdash;Northumberland House, York House, Baynard&#8217;s Castle, the scene of the
secret interview between the Duke of York and the Earls of Salisbury and
Warwick, was singled out, between Paul&#8217;s Wharf and Puddle Dock. Next to
the Temple, and between it and Whitefriars, was the region<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> known as
Alsatia. Here safe from every document but the writ of the Lord Chief
Justice and the Lords of the Privy Council, in dark dwellings, with
subterranean passages, narrow streets, and trap-doors that led to the
Thames, dwelt all the rascaldom of the time&mdash;men who had been &#8216;horned&#8217; or
outlawed, bankrupts, coiners, thieves, cheaters at dice and cards,
duellists, homicides, and foreign bravoes, ready to do any desperate deed.
At night the contents of this kingdom of villany were sprayed out over
London, to the bewilderment of good-natured Dogberries, and country
gentlemen, making their first visit to town.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still further down the river was the famous London Bridge. It consisted
of twenty arches; its roadway was sixty feet from the river; and the
length of the bridge from end to end was 926 feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was one of the wonders that strangers never ceased to admire. Its many
shops were occupied by pin nacres, just beginning to feel the competition
with the Netherland pin-makers, and the tower at its Southwark end was
adorned with three hundred heads, stuck on poles, like gigantic pins,
memorials of treachery and heresy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The roar of the river through the arches was almost deafening. &#8216;The noise
at London Bridge is nothing near her,&#8217; says one of the characters in
Beaumont and Fletcher&#8217;s <i>Woman&#8217;s Prize</i>. Shakespeare, Ben Jonson &amp; Co.,
must have crossed the bridge many a time on their visits to the City, to
&#8216;gather humours of men daily,&#8217; as Aubrey quaintly expresses it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The name of Ben Jonson reminds us that in <i>The Silent Woman</i>,&mdash;one of the
most popular of his Comedies,&mdash;we have presented to us a more vivid
picture than can elsewhere be found of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> the characteristic noises, and
street-cries of London more than two centuries ago. It is easy to form to
ourselves a general idea of the hum and buzz of the bees and drones of
this mighty hive, under a state of manners essentially different from our
own; but it is not so easy to attain a lively conception of the particular
sounds that once went to make up this great discord, and so to compare
them in their resemblances and their differences with the roar which the
great Babel <i>now</i> &#8220;sends through all her gates.&#8221; We propose, therefore, to
put before our readers this passage of Jonson&#8217;s comedy; and then,
classifying what he describes, illustrate our fine old dramatic painter of
manners by references to other writers, and by the results of our own
observation.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img055.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The principal character of Jonson&#8217;s <i>Silent Woman</i> is founded upon a
sketch by a Greek writer of the fourth century, Libanius. Jonson
designates this character by the name of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> &#8220;Morose;&#8221; and his peculiarity is
that he can bear no kind of noise, not even that of ordinary talk. The
plot turns upon this affectation; for having been entrapped into a
marriage with the &#8220;Silent Woman,&#8221; she and her friends assail him with
tongues the most obstreperous, and clamours the most uproarious, until, to
be relieved of this nuisance, he comes to terms with his nephew for a
portion of his fortune and is relieved of the &#8220;Silent Woman,&#8221; who is in
reality a boy in disguise. We extract the dialogue of the whole scene; the
speakers being &#8220;Truewitt,&#8221; &#8220;Clerimont,&#8221; and a &#8220;Page&#8221;:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<i>True.</i> I met that stiff piece of formality, Master Morose, his
uncle, yesterday, with a huge turban of night-caps on his head,
buckled over his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cler.</i> O! that&#8217;s his custom when he walks abroad. He can endure no
noise, man.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>True.</i> So I have heard. But is the disease so ridiculous in him as
it is made? They say he has been upon divers treaties with the
fish-wives and orange-women; and articles propounded between them:
marry, the chimney-sweepes will not be drawn in.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cler.</i> No, nor the broom-men: they stand out stiffly. He cannot
endure a costard-monger; he swoons if he hear one.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>True.</i> Methinks a smith should be ominous.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cler.</i> Or any hammer-man. A brasier is not suffer&#8217;d to dwell in the
parish, nor an armourer. He would have hang&#8217;d a pewterer&#8217;s &#8217;prentice
once upon a Shrove-Tuesday&#8217;s riot, for being of that trade, when the
rest were quit.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>True.</i> A trumpet should fright him terribly, or the hautboys.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cler.</i> Out of his senses. The waits of the City have a pension of
him not to come near that ward. This youth practised on him one night
like the bellman, and never left till he had brought him down to the
door with a long sword; and there left him flourishing with the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Page.</i> Why, sir, he hath chosen a street to lie in, so narrow at
both ends that it will receive no coaches, nor carts, nor any of these
common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> noises; and therefore we that love him devise to bring him in
such as we may now and then, for his exercise, to breathe him. He
would grow resty else in his cage; his virtue would rust without
action. I entreated a bearward, one day, to come down with the dogs of
some four parishes that way, and I thank him he did; and cried his
games under Master Morose&#8217;s window; till he was sent crying away, with
his head made a most bleeding spectacle to the multitude. And, another
time, a fencer marching to his prize had his drum most tragically run
through, for taking that street in his way at my request.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>True.</i> A good wag! How does he for the bells?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Cler.</i> O! In the queen&#8217;s time he was wont to go out of town every
Saturday at ten o&#8217;clock, or on holiday eves. But now, by reason of the
sickness, the perpetuity of ringing has made him devise a room with
double walls and treble ceilings; the windows close shut and caulk&#8217;d;
and there he lives by candlelight.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The first class of noises, then, against which &#8220;Morose&#8221; protected his ears
by &#8220;a huge turban of night-caps,&#8221; is that of the ancient and far-famed
<span class="smcap">London Cries</span>. We have here the very loudest of them&mdash;fish-wives,
orange-women, chimney-sweepers, broom-men, costard-mongers. But we might
almost say that there were <i>hundreds</i> of other cries; and therefore,
reserving to ourselves some opportunity for a special enumeration of a few
of the more remarkable of these cries, we shall now slightly group them,
as they present themselves to our notice during successive generations.</p>

<p>We shall not readily associate any very agreeable sounds with the voices
of the &#8220;fish-wives.&#8221; The one who cried &#8220;<i>Mackerel</i>&#8221; in Lydgate&#8217;s day had
probably no such explanatory cry as the &#8220;<i>Mackerel alive, alive ho!</i>&#8221; of
modern times. In the seventeenth century the cry was &#8220;<i>New Mackerel</i>.&#8221; And
in the same way there was:&mdash;</p>

<p>In this extraordinary gathering together of the producers of the most
discordant sounds, we have a representation which may fairly match the
dramatist&#8217;s description of street noises. Here we have the milk-maid&#8217;s
scream, the mackerel seller&#8217;s shout, the sweep upon the house top,&mdash;to
match the fish-wives and orange-women, the broom-men and costard-mongers.
The smith, who was &#8220;ominous,&#8221; had no longer his forge in the busy streets
of Hogarth&#8217;s time; the armourer was obsolete: but Hogarth can rival their
noises with the pavior&#8217;s hammer, the sow-gelder&#8217;s horn, and the
knife-grinder&#8217;s wheel. The waits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> the city had a pension not to come
near &#8220;Morose&#8217;s&#8221; ward; but it was out of the power of the &#8220;Enraged
Musician&#8221; to avert the terrible discord of the blind hautboy-player. The
bellman who frightened the sleepers at midnight, was extinct; but modern
London had acquired the dustman&#8217;s bell. The bear-ward no longer came down
the street with the dogs of four parishes, nor did the fencer march with a
drum to his prize; but there was the ballad-singer, with her squalling
child, roaring worse than bear or dog; and the drum of the little boy
playing at soldiers was a more abiding nuisance than the fencer. &#8220;Morose&#8221;
and the &#8220;Enraged Musician&#8221; had each the church bells to fill up the
measure of discord.</p>

<p>The fish-wives are no longer seen in our great city of London
thoroughfares. In Tottenham Court-road, Hoxton, Shoreditch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Kingsland,
Whitechapel, Hackney-road, and many other suburban districts, which still
retain the character of a street-market, they stand in long rows as the
evening draws in, with paper-lanterns stuck in their baskets on dark
nights; and there they vociferate as loudly as in the olden time.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img060.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The &#8220;costard-monger&#8221; whom Morose dreaded, still lives amongst us, and is
still noisy. He bawls so loud even to this day, that he puts his hand
behind his ear to mitigate the sensation which he inflicts upon his own
tympanum. He was originally an apple-seller, whence his name; and, from
the mention of him in the old dramatists, he appears to have been
frequently an Irishman. In Jonson&#8217;s &#8220;Bartholomew Fair,&#8221; he cries
&#8220;<i>pears</i>.&#8221; Ford makes him cry &#8220;<i>pippins</i>.&#8221; He is a quarrelsome fellow,
according to Beaumont and Fletcher:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>The costermonger is now a travelling shopkeeper. We encounter him not in
Cornhill, or Holborn, or the Strand: in the neighbourhood of the great
markets and well-stored shops he travels not. But his voice is heard in
some silent streets stretching into the suburbs; and there, with his
donkey and hampers stands at the door, as the servant-maid cheapens a
bundle of cauliflowers. He has monopolized all the trades that were
anciently represented by such cries as &#8220;<i>Buy my artichokes, mistress</i>;&#8221;
&#8220;<i>Ripe cowcumbers</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>White onions, white St. Thomas&#8217; onions</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>White
radish</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>Ripe young beans</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>Any baking pears</i>;&#8221; &#8220;<i>Ripe
sparrowgrass</i>.&#8221; He would be indignant to encounter such petty chapmen
interfering with his wholesale operations. He would rail against them as
the city shopkeepers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries railed
against itinerant traders of every denomination. In the days of Elizabeth,
they declare by act of common council, that in ancient times the open
streets and lanes of the city have been used, and ought to be used, as the
common highway only, and not for hucksters, pedlars, and hagglers, to
stand or sit to sell their wares in, and to pass from street to street
hawking and offering their wares. In the seventh year of Charles I. the
same authorities denounce the oyster-wives, herb-wives, tripe-wives, and
the like, as &#8220;unruly people;&#8221; and they charge them somewhat unjustly, as
it must appear, with &#8220;framing to themselves a way whereby to live a more
easy life than by labour.&#8221;</p>

<tr><td>&#8220;How busy is the man the world calls idle!&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>The evil, as the citizens term it, seems to have increased; for in 1694
the common council threatened the pedlars and petty chapmen with the
terrors of the laws against rogues and sturdy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> beggars, the least penalty
being whipping, whether for male or female. The reason for this terrible
denunciation is very candidly put: the citizens and shopkeepers are
greatly hindered and prejudiced in their trades by the hawkers and
pedlars. Such denunciations as these had little share in putting down the
itinerant traders. They continued to flourish, because society required
them; and they vanished from our view when society required them no
longer. In the middle of the last century they were fairly established as
rivals to the shopkeepers. Dr. Johnson, than whom no man knew London
better, thus writes in the &#8220;Adventurer:&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;The attention of a new-comer is
generally first struck by the multiplicity of cries that stun him in the
streets, and the variety of merchandise and manufactures which the
shopkeepers expose on every hand.&#8221; The shopkeepers have now ruined the
itinerants&mdash;not by putting them down by fiery penalties, but by the
competition amongst themselves to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> every article at hand for every
man&#8217;s use, which shall be better and cheaper than the wares of the
itinerant. Whose ear is now ever deafened by the cries of the broom-man?
He was a sturdy fellow in the days of old &#8220;Morose,&#8221; carrying on a barter
which in itself speaks of the infancy of civilization. His cry was &#8220;<i>Old
Shoes for some Brooms</i>.&#8221; Those proclamations for barter no doubt furnished
a peculiar characteristic of the old London Cries. The itinerant buyers
were as loud, though not so numerous, as the sellers.</p>

appear to possess a monopoly in the purchase and sale of dilapidated
costumes? Why should their voices, and theirs alone, be employed in the
constant iteration of the talismanic monosyllables &#8220;Old Clo&#8217;?&#8221; Is it
because Judas carried the bag that all the children of Israel are to
trudge through London streets to the end of their days with sack on
shoulder? Artists generally represent the old clothesman with three, and
sometimes four, hats, superposed one above the other. Now, although we
have seen him with many hats in his hands or elsewhere, we never yet saw
him with more than one hat on his head. The three-hatted clothesman, if
ever he existed, is obsolete. According to Ingoldsby, however, when
&#8220;Portia&#8221; pronounced the law adverse to &#8220;Shylock&#8221;:</p>

<p>There was trading then going forward from house to house, which careful
housewifery and a more vigilant police have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> banished from the daylight,
if they have not extirpated it altogether. Before the shops are open and
the chimneys send forth their smoke, there may be now, sometimes, seen
creeping up an area a sly-looking beldam, who treads as stealthily as a
cat. Under her cloak she has a pan, whose unctuous contents will some day
assist in the enlightenment or purification of the world, in the form of
candles or soap. But the good lady of the house, who is a late riser,
knows not of the transformation that is going forward. In the old days she
would have heard the cry of a maiden, with tub on head and pence in hand,
of &#8220;<i>Any Kitchen-stuff have you Maids?</i>&#8221; and she probably would have dealt
with her herself, or have forbidden her maids to deal.</p>

<p>So it is with the old cry of &#8220;<i>Any Old Iron take Money for?</i>&#8221; The fellow
who then went openly about with sack on back was a thief, and an

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in his <i>Fortunes of Nigel</i>, has left us a capital
description of the shop of a London tradesman during the reign of King
James in England, the shop in question being that of David Ramsay, maker
of watches and horologes, within Temple-bar&mdash;a few yards eastward of St.
Dunstan&#8217;s church, Fleet-street, and where his apprentice, Jenkin
Vincent&mdash;abbreviated to Jin Vin, when not engaged in &#8217;prentices-riots&mdash;is
crying to every likely passer-by:&mdash;</p>

<p>The verbal proclaimers of the excellence of their commodities, had this
advantage over those who, in the present day, use the public papers for
the same purpose, that they could in many cases adapt their address to the
peculiar appearance and apparent taste of the passengers. This direct and
personal mode of invitation to customers became, however, a dangerous
temptation to the young wags who were employed in the task of solicitation
during the absence of the principal person interested in the traffic; and,
confiding in their numbers and civic union, the &#8217;prentices of London were
often seduced into taking liberties with the passengers, and exercising
their wit at the expense of those whom they had no hopes of converting
into customers by their eloquence. If this were resented by any act of
violence, the inmates of each shop were ready to pour forth in succour;
and in the words of an old song which Dr. Johnson was used to hum,&mdash;</p>

<p>Desperate riots often arose on such occasions, especially when the
Templars, or other youths connected with the aristocracy, were insulted,
or conceived themselves so to be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> Upon such occasions, bare steel was
frequently opposed to the clubs of the citizens, and death sometimes
ensued on both sides. The tardy and inefficient police of the time had no
other resource than by the Alderman of the ward calling out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
householders, and putting a stop to the strife by overpowering numbers, as
the Capulets and Montagues are separated upon the stage.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that these &#8217;prentices of the City of London were
of mean and humble origin. The sons of freemen of the City, or country
boys of good and honourable families, alone were admitted to the seven
years&#8217; apprenticeship. The common people&mdash;the <i>ascripti gleb&aelig;</i>&mdash;the poor
rustics who were bound to the soil, had little or no share in the fortunes
of the City of London. Many of the burgesses were as proud of their
descent as of their liberties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Once apprenticed, and having in a few weeks imbibed the spirit of the
place, the lad became a Londoner. It is one of the characteristics of
London, that he who comes up to the City from the country speedily becomes
penetrated with the magic of the golden pavement, and falls in love with
the great City. And he who has once felt that love of London can never
again be happy beyond the sound of Bow Bells, which could formerly be
heard for ten miles and more. The greatness of the City, its history, its
associations, its ambitions, its pride, its hurrying crowds&mdash;all these
things affect the imagination and fill the heart. There is no place in the
world, and never has been, which so stirs the heart of her children with
love and pride as the City of London.</p>

<p>A year or two later on, the boy would learn, with his fellow-&#8217;prentices
that he must betake himself to the practice of bow and arrow, &#8220;pellet and
bolt,&#8221; with a view to what might happen. Moorfields was convenient for the
volunteers of the time. There was, however, never any lack of excitement
and novelty in the City of London. But this is a digression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Amongst the earliest of the Cries of London we must class the &#8220;cry&#8221; of the
City watchman; although it essentially differed from the &#8220;cries&#8221; of the
shopkeepers and the hawkers; for they, as a rule, had something to
exchange or sell&mdash;<i>copen or buy?</i> as Lydgate puts it&mdash;then the watchmen
were wont to commence their &#8220;cry&#8221; at, or about, the hour of night when all
others had finished for the day. After that it was the business of the
watchman to make his first call, or cry after the manner inscribed over
the figure here given.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img070.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>He had to deal with deaf listeners, and he therefore proclaimed with a
voice of command, &#8220;Lanthorn!&#8221; but a lanthorn alone was a body without a
soul; and he therefore demanded &#8220;a <i>whole</i> candle.&#8221; To render the mandate
less individually oppressive, he went on to cry, &#8220;Hang out your Lights!&#8221;
And, that even the sleepers might sleep no more, he ended with &#8220;Heare!&#8221; It
will be seen that he carries his staff and lanthorn with the air of honest
old Dogberry about him,&mdash;&#8220;A good man and true,&#8221; and &#8220;the most desartless
man to be constable.&#8221;</p>

<p>The making of lanthorns was a great trade in the early times. We clung to
King Alfred&#8217;s invention for the preservation of light with as reverend a
love, during many centuries, as we bestowed upon his civil institutions.
The horn of the favoured utensil was a very dense medium for illumination,
but science had substituted nothing better; and, even when progressing
people carried about a neat glass instrument with a brilliant reflector,
the watchman held to his ponderous and murky relic of the past, making
&#8220;night hideous&#8221; with his voice, to give news of the weather, such as:
&#8220;Past eleven, and a starlight night;&#8221; or &#8220;Past one o&#8217;clock, and a windy
morning;&#8221; in fact, disturbed your rest to tell you &#8220;what&#8217;s o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>We are told by the chroniclers that, as early as 1416, the mayor, Sir
Henry Barton, ordered lanthorns and lights to be hanged out on the winter
evenings, betwixt Allhallows and Candlemass. For three centuries this
practice subsisted, constantly evaded, no doubt through the avarice or
poverty of individuals, sometimes probably disused altogether, but still
the custom of London up to the time of Queen Anne. The cry of the
watchman, &#8220;Hang out your Lights,&#8221; was an exhortation to the negligent,
which probably they answered only by snores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> equally indifferent to their
own safety and the public preservation. A worthy mayor in the time of
Queen Mary provided the watchman with a bell, with which instrument he
accompanied the music of his voice down to the days of the Commonwealth.
The &#8220;Statutes of the Streets,&#8221; in the time of Elizabeth, were careful
enough for the preservation of silence in some things. They prescribed
that, &#8220;no man shall blow any horn in the night, or whistle after the hour
of nine o&#8217;clock in the night, under pain of imprisonment;&#8221; and, what was a
harder thing to keep, they also forbade a man to make any &#8220;sudden outcry
in the still of the night, as making any affray, or beating his wife.&#8221; Yet
a privileged man was to go about knocking at doors and ringing his
alarum&mdash;an intolerable nuisance if he did what he was ordered to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>But the watchmen were, no doubt, wise in their generation. With honest
Dogberry, they could not &#8220;see how sleeping should offend;&#8221; and after the
watch was set, they probably agreed to &#8220;go sit upon the church bench till
two, and then all to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bellman&mdash;from Dekker, 1608.</span></p>

<p>We have observed in our old statutes, and in the pages of authors of
various kinds, that separate mention is made of the Watchman and the
Bellman. No doubt there were several degrees of office in the ancient
Watch and Ward system, and that part of the office of the old Watch, or
Bellman, was to bless the sleepers, whose door he passed, which blessing
was often sung or said in verse&mdash;hence Bellman&#8217;s verse. These verses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> were
in many cases, the relics of the old incantations to keep off elves and
hobgoblins. There is a curious work by Thomas Dekker&mdash;otherwise
Decker,&mdash;entitled: &#8220;The Bellman of London. Bringing to light the most
notorious Villanies that are now practised in the Kingdom, Profitable for
Gentlemen, Lawyers, Merchants, Citizens, Farmers, Masters of Households
and all sortes of servants to Marke, and delightful for all men to Reade,
<i>Lege, Perlege, Relege</i>.&#8221; Printed at London for Nathaniel Butter, 1608.
Where he describes the Bellman as a person of some activity&mdash;&#8220;the child of
darkness; a common nightwalker; a man that had no man to wait upon him,
but only a dog; one that was a disordered person, and at midnight would
beat at men&#8217;s doors, bidding them (in mere mockery) to look to their
candles, when they themselves were in their dead sleeps.&#8221; Stow says that
in Queen Mary&#8217;s day one of each ward &#8220;began to go all night with a bell,
and at every lane&#8217;s end, and at the ward&#8217;s end, gave warning of fire and
candle, and to help the poor and pray for the dead.&#8221; Milton, in his &#8220;Il
Penseroso,&#8221; has:&mdash;</p>

<p>But, with or without a bell, the real prosaic watchman continued to make
the same demand as his predecessors for lights through a long series of
years; and his demand tells us plainly that London was a city without
lamps. But though he was a prosaic person, he had his own verses. He
addressed himself to the &#8220;maids.&#8221; He exhorted them to make their lanthorns
&#8220;bright and clear.&#8221; He told them how long their candles were expected to
burn. And, finally, like a considerate lawgiver, he gave reason for his
edict:&mdash;</p>

<p>Formerly it was the duty of the bellman of St. Sepulchre&#8217;s parish, near
Newgate, to rouse the unfortunates condemned to death in that prison, the
night before their execution, and solemnly exhort them to repentance with
good words in bad rhyme, ending with</p>

<p>It was customary for the bellman to present at Christmas time to each
householder in his district &#8220;A Copy of Verses,&#8221; and he expected from each
in return some small gratuity. The execrable character of his poetry is
indicated by the contempt with which the wits speak of &#8220;Bellman&#8217;s verses&#8221;

the present parish Bellman mostly took their <i>own</i> (!) &#8220;Copy of Verses.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Luttrell Collection of Broadsides (Brit. Mus.) is one dated 1683-4,
entitled, &#8220;A Copy of Verses presented by Isaac Ragg, Bellman, to the
Masters and Mistresses of Holbourn Division, in the Parish of St.
Giles&#8217;s-in-the-Fields.&#8221; It is headed by a woodcut representing Isaac in
his professional accoutrements, a pointed pole in his left hand, and in
the right a bell, while his lanthorn hangs from his jacket in front; below
is a series of verses, the only specimen worth giving here being the
expression of Mr. Ragg&#8217;s official duty; it is as follows:&mdash;</p>

And we&#8217;ll soon have a new one in lieu of the latter.<br />
Our rulers have grappled with one of our crosses,<br />
While for beauty and fitness the other no loss is.<br />
And still more to make up for these drawbacks vexatious,<br />
Dame Fortune has been on the whole, pretty gracious.<br />
We&#8217;ve had peace to get wealth, which of war is the sinews.<br />
Grant us wit to make hay while the sunshine continues.<br />
Then, the Bear of the North, that insatiate beast,<br />
Has been check&#8217;d in his wily attempts on the East;<br />
And his further insidious advances forbidden<br />
By the broadsword of Auckland, which warns him from Eden.<br />
While our rulers, in earnest, apply to the work,<br />
And a treaty concludes with the Austrian and Turk,<br />

Museum, containing twelve cries, with figures of the &#8220;Criers&#8221; and the
cries themselves beneath. The cuts are singularly characteristic, and may
be assigned with safety, on the authority of Mr. John Thomas Smith, the
late keeper of the prints and drawings, as of the same date as Ben
Jonson&#8217;s &#8220;fish-wives,&#8221; &#8220;costard-mongers,&#8221; and &#8220;orange women.&#8221;</p>

and a lanthorn, is well secured in a good frieze gabardine,
leathern-girdle, and wears a serviceable hat to guard against the weather.
The worthy here depicted has a most venerable face and beard, showing how
ancient was the habit of parish officers to select the poor and feeble for
the office of watchman, in order to keep them out of the poor-house. The

<p>In the same collection, is a series of three plates, &#8220;Part of the Cries in
London,&#8221; evidently belonging to the same set, though only one has got a
title. Each plate contains thirty-six criers, with the addition of a
principal &#8220;Crier&#8221; in the centre. These were evidently executed abroad, as
late, perhaps, as the reign of Charles II. No. 1 (with the title page) is
ornamented in the centre with the &#8220;Rat-Catcher,&#8221; carrying an emblazoned
banner of rats, and attended by a boy. The leather investment of the
rat-catcher of the present day is a pleasant memorial of the banner of the
past. Beneath the rat-catcher, the following lines occur:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Proving, evidently that the rat-catcher courted more to his banner than
his poetry. Then follow the thirty-six cries, some of which, it will be
seen, are extremely curious. The names are given beneath the cuts, but
without any verse or peculiarity of cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haie ye any work for John Cooper?&#8221; is the title of one of the Martin
Marprelate pamphlets. &#8220;Haie ye ani gold ends to sell?&#8221; is mentioned as a
&#8220;cry,&#8221; in &#8220;Pappe with a Hatchet&#8221; (<i>cir.</i> 1589). &#8220;Camphires,&#8221; means
Samphires. The &#8220;Alminake&#8221; man has completely gone, and &#8220;Old Dublets&#8221; has
degenerated into &#8220;Ogh Clo,&#8221; a &#8220;cry&#8221; which teased Coleridge for a time, and
occasioned a ludicrous incident, which we had reserved for a place
somewhat later in our history, had not &#8220;Old Dublets&#8221; brought it, not
inopportunely, to mind. &#8220;The other day,&#8221; said Coleridge, &#8220;I was what you
would call <i>floored</i> by a Jew. He passed me several times crying out for
old clothes, in the most nasal and extraordinary tone I ever heard. At
last I was so provoked, that I said to him, &#8216;Pray, why can&#8217;t you say &#8216;old
clothes&#8217; in a plain way, as I do?&#8217; The Jew stopped, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> looking very
gravely at me, said in a clear and even accent, &#8216;Sir, I can say &#8216;old
clothes&#8217; as well as you can; but if you had to say so ten times a minute,
for an hour together, you would say <i>Ogh Clo</i> as I do now;&#8217; and so he
marched off.&#8221; Coleridge was so confounded with the justice of the retort
that he followed and gave him a shilling&mdash;the only one he had.</p>

<p>The principal figure on the second plate is the &#8220;Bellman,&#8221; with dog, bell,

<p>The only crier in the series who has a horse and cart to attend him is the
Worcestershire salt-man. Salt is still sold from carts in poor and crowded
neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>We have been somewhat surprised in not finding a single Thames waterman
among the criers of London; but the series was, perhaps, confined to the
streets of London, and the watermen were thought to belong altogether to
the stairs leading to their silent highway. Three of their cries have
given titles to three good old English comedies, &#8220;Northward, ho!&#8221;
&#8220;Eastward, ho!&#8221; and &#8220;Westward, ho!&#8221; But our series of cries is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> still
extremely incomplete. Every thing in early times was carried and cried,
and we have seen two rare prints of old London Cries not to be found in
the lists already enumerated. One is called &#8220;<i>Clove Water, Stomock
Water</i>,&#8221; and the other &#8220;<i>Buy an new Booke</i>.&#8221; Others may still exist. In
the Duke of Devonshire&#8217;s collection of drawings, by Inigo Jones, are
several cries, drawn in pen-and-ink, for the masques at court in the
reigns of James I. and Charles I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>In Thomas Heywood&#8217;s, &#8220;<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>, a True Roman Tragedy, acted
by Her Majestie&#8217;s Servants at the <i>Red-Bull</i>, 1609,&#8221; is the following long
list of <span class="smcap">London Cries</span>, but called for the sake of the dramatic action of
the scene, &#8220;<i>Cries of Rome</i>,&#8221; which was the common practice with the old
dramatists, Rome being the canting name of London. Robert Greene, in his
&#8220;<i>Perimedes the Blacksmith</i>, 1588,&#8221; when he wished to criticise the London
<i>Theatre</i> at Shoreditch, talks of the <i>Theatre in Rome</i>; also in his
&#8220;<i>Never too Late</i>, 1590,&#8221; when he talks of the London actors, he pretends
only to speak of Roscius and the actors of <i>Rome</i>. In the pedlar&#8217;s French
of the day Rome-vyle&mdash;or ville&mdash;was London, and Rome-mort the Queen
[Elizabeth]. There is some humour in the classification, and if the cries
were well imitated by the singer, the ballad&mdash;or as it would then be
called &#8220;<i>jig</i>&#8221;&mdash;is likely to have been extremely popular in its day.</p>

<p>Thomas Morely, a musical composer, set music of four, six, eight and ten
parts, to the cries in his time, among them are some used by the
milliners&#8217; girls in the New Exchange, which was on the south side of the
Strand, opposite the now Adelphi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> Theatre, it was built in the reign of
James I., and pulled down towards the end of the last century; among
others are &#8220;<i>Italian falling Bands</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>French Garters</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>Robatos</i>,&#8221; a
kind of ruff then fashionable, &#8220;<i>Nun&#8217;s Thread</i>,&#8221; <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The effeminacy and coxcombry of a man&#8217;s ruff and band are well ridiculed
by many of our dramatic writers. There is a small tract bearing the
following title&mdash;&#8220;A Merrie Dialogue between Band, Cuffe and Ruffe. Done by
an excellent Wit, and lately acted in a Shew in the Famous Universitie of
Cambridge. London, printed by W. Stansby for Miles Partrich, and are to be
sold at his shop neere Saint Dunstone&#8217;s Church-yard in Fleet Street,
1615.&#8221; This <i>brochure</i> is a <i>bonne-bouche</i> of the period, written in
dramatic dialogue form, and full of puns as any modern comedy or farcical
sketch from the pen of the greatest word-twister of the day&mdash;Henry J.
Byron (who, on <i>Cyril&#8217;s Success</i>, <i>Married in Haste</i>, <i>Our Boys</i>, and <i>The
Girls</i>,)&mdash;and is of considerable value as an illustration of the history
of the costume of the period. The band, as an article of ornament for the
neck, was the common wear of gentlemen, though now exclusively retained by
the clergy and lawyers; the cuff, as a fold at the end of a sleeve, or the
part of the sleeve turned back from the hand, was made highly fantastical
by means of &#8220;cut work;&#8221; the ruff, as a female neck ornament, made of
plaited lawn, or other material, is well-known, but it was formerly worn
by both sexes.</p>

lengths, furnished with the implements of their various trades, or with
the articles in which they deal. The Watchman (one of the best) is a fine
old fellow, with a broad brim to his hat, a reverential beard, a halberd
in one hand, and a lanthorn in the other (after the manner of the one we
have given at <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>). But perhaps the most curious engraving in the set
is the &#8220;cry&#8221; called &#8220;Some broken breade and meate for y<sup>e</sup> poore
prisoners: for the Lord&#8217;s sake pittey the poore.&#8221; This represents a poor
prisoner with a sealed box in his hand, and a basket at his back&mdash;the box
for alms in the shape of money, and the basket for broken bread and meat.

<p>Squire Cokes hears this, and says, &#8220;Ballads! hark, hark! pray thee,
fellow, stay a little! what ballads hast thou? let me see, let me see
myself&mdash;How dost thou call it? <i>A Caveat against Cut-purses!</i>&mdash;a good jest

then shows his purse boastingly, and enquires &#8220;Ballad-man, do any
cut-purses haunt hereabout? pray thee raise me one or two: begin and show
me one.&#8221; Nightingale answers, &#8220;Sir, this is a spell against &#8217;em, spick and
span new: and &#8217;tis made as &#8217;twere in mine own person, and I sing it in
mine own defence. But &#8217;twill cost a penny alone if you buy it.&#8221; The Squire
replies: &#8220;No matter for the price; thou dost not know me, I see, I am an
old <i>Bartholomew</i>.&#8221; The ballad has &#8220;pictures,&#8221; and Nightingale tells him,
&#8220;It was intended, sir, as if a purse should chance to be cut in my
presence, now, I may be blameless though; as by the sequel will more
plainly appear.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;It is, to the tune of <i>Paggington&#8217;s Pound</i>,

<p>While Nightingale sings this ballad, a fellow tickles Coke&#8217;s ear with a
straw, to make him withdraw his hand from his pocket, and privately robs
him of his purse, which, at the end of the song, he secretly conveys to
the ballad-singer; who notwithstanding his &#8220;Caveat against cut-purses,&#8221; is
their principal confederate, and in that quality, becomes the unsuspected
depository of the plunder.</p>

<p><i>Shancke.</i>&mdash;John Shancke the comic actor here mentioned was celebrated for
singing rhymes, and what were technically &#8220;jigs&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> on the stage. In this
respect, as a low comedian he had been the legitimate successor of
Tarlton, Kempe, Phillips, and Singer. He was on the stage from 1603 to
1635, when he died. Then, John Taylor the <i>Water Poet</i>, no mean authority,
informs us that the Swan Theatre, on the Bankside, in the Liberty of Paris
Gardens, had been abandoned by the players in 1613. The Curtain Theatre in
Holywell street&mdash;or Halliwell street, as it was usually spelt at that
time&mdash;Shoreditch Fields<a name='fna_7' id='fna_7' href='#f_7'><small>[7]</small></a> had also fallen into disuse before the reign of
Charles I. The Globe on the Bankside, and the [Red] Bull Theatre at the
upper end of St. John&#8217;s street, Clerkenwell were employed until after the
restoration. The allusion to the Waterman carrying &#8220;bonny lasses over to
the plays,&#8221; is also a curious note of time. With these matters before us,
we may safely conclude that &#8220;Turner&#8217;s Dish of Stuff&#8221; is but a reprint of
an earlier production. As we find it, so we lay it before our readers:
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>The best known collection of cries is &#8220;The Cryes of the City of London.
Drawne after the Life. P. Tempest, <i>Excudit</i>,&#8221; a small folio volume, which
when published, in 1688, consisted of only fifty plates, as the following
advertisement, extracted from the <i>London Gazette</i> of May 28-31, 1688,
sufficiently proves:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;There is now published the Cryes and Habits of London, lately drawn
after the Life in great variety of Actions. Curiously Engraven upon 50
Copper plates, fit for the Ingenious and Lovers of Art. Printed and
Sold by P. Tempest, over-against Somerset House, in the Strand.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Samuel Pepys, the eccentric diarist, who died 1703, left to Magdalene
College, Cambridge, an invaluable collection of ballads, manuscript naval
memoirs, ancient English poetry, three volumes of &#8220;Penny Merriments,&#8221; and
a numerous assemblage of etchings and engravings. Among the latter are a
number of Tempest&#8217;s Cries in the first state. These are still preserved in
the Pepysian Library in the same College.</p>

<p>In 1711 another edition of Tempest&#8217;s Cries was published, containing
seventy-four plates, several of which can scarcely be called cries. They
are popular &#8220;London Characters&#8221; rather than &#8220;criers.&#8221; As the book,
however, is extremely rare, and consequently costly, and as a history of
the old London Cries would be very imperfect without a particular account
of Tempest&#8217;s volume being made, with a few words about Mauron, who
designed, and Pearce Tempest, who engraved these cries, that which follows
will not, we trust, be altogether out of place. Of Mauron, we can find no
better account than the notice in Walpole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>&#8220;Marcellus Mauron&mdash;sometimes spelt Lauron, was born at the Hague in 1643,
and learnt to paint of his father, with whom he came when young into
England. Here he was placed with one La Zoon, a portrait-painter, and then
with Flesshier, but owed his chief improvement to his own application. He
lived several years in Yorkshire, and when he returned again to London he
had very much improved himself in his art. He drew correctly, studied
nature diligently, copied closely, and so surpassed all his contemporaries
in drapery, that Sir Godfrey Kneller employed him to clothe his portraits.
He likewise excelled in imitating the different styles of eminent masters,
executed conversation pieces of considerable merit. Several prints were
made from his works, and several plates he etched and scraped himself. A
book on fencing, and the procession at the coronation of William and Mary,
were designed by him. He lived in Bow-street, Covent-garden, on the west
side, about three doors up, and at the back of Sir Godfrey Kneller&#8217;s house
in the Piazza; there he died of consumption March 11th, 1702.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of Pearce Tempest, the engraver, the particulars collected by Vertue were
so extremely slight that Horace Walpole merely enumerates him among those
of whom nothing is known. It may be told of him, however, that he lived in
the Strand, over-against Somerset House, and dying in 1717, was buried on
the 14th of April, in the church-yard of St. Paul, Covent-garden.</p>

appear in Marcellus Mauron <i>cum</i> Tempest&#8217;s &#8220;The Cryes of the City of

a pint measure and funnel at his side. But since Mauron&#8217;s time the cry of

<p>He carried them, as represented in the engraving, in a partitioned frame,
on his shoulder, and to each horse&#8217;s head was a small flag with two bells
attached. It was a pretty plaything for a &#8220;little master,&#8221; and helped him

<p>The &#8220;orange-women&#8221; of Ben Jonson we have figured to the life. The familiar
mention of the orange-sellers in the &#8220;Silent Woman,&#8221; and this very early
representation of one of them, show how general the use of this fruit had
become in England at the beginning of the seventeenth century. It is
stated, though the story is somewhat apocryphal, that the first oranges
were imported by Sir Walter Raleigh. It is probable that about his time
they first became an article of general commerce. We now consume about
three hundred and fifty millions of oranges every year.</p>

<p>The class of bold young women&mdash;&#8220;Orange Wenches,&#8221; that Nell Gwynne made
famous is sufficiently alluded to in a passage in the <i>Spectator</i>, No.

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;But, indeed, by such representations, a poet sacrifices the best part
of his audience to the worst; and, as one would think, neglects the

<p>There is nothing which more astonishes a foreigner, and frightens a
country &#8217;squire, than the <i>cries of London</i>. My good friend Sir <i>Roger</i>
often declares that he cannot get them out of his head, or go to sleep for
them, the first week that he is in town. On the contrary, <i>Will
Honeycombe</i> calls them the <i>Ramage de la ville</i>, and prefers them to the
sound of larks, and nightingales, with all the music of the fields and
woods. I have lately received a letter from some very odd fellow upon this
subject, which I shall leave with my reader, without saying anything
further of it.</p>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>I am a man out of all business, and would willingly turn my head to
anything for an honest livelihood. I have invented several projects for
raising many millions of money without burdening the subject, but I cannot
get the parliament to listen to me, who look upon me forsooth as a crack,
and a projector; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> that despairing to enrich either myself or my country
by this public-spiritedness, I would make some proposals to you relating
to a design which I have very much at heart, and which may procure me a
handsome subsistence, if you will be pleased to recommend it to the cities
of London and Westminster.</p>

<p>The post I would aim at, is to be comptroller-general of the London cries,
which are at present under no manner of rules or discipline. I think I am
pretty well qualified for this place, as being a man of very strong lungs,
of great insight into all the branches of our British trades and
manufactures, and of a competent skill in music.</p>

<p>The cries of London may be divided into vocal and instrumental. A freeman
of London has the privilege of disturbing a whole street for an hour
together with the twankling of a brass kettle or a frying-pan. The
watchman&#8217;s thump at midnight startles us in our beds, as much as the
breaking in of a thief. The sow-gelder&#8217;s horn has indeed something musical
in it, but this is seldom heard within the liberties. I would therefore
propose that no instrument of this nature should be made use of, which I
have not tuned and licensed, after having carefully examined in what
manner it may affect the ears of her majesty&#8217;s liege subjects.</p>

<p>Vocal cries are of a much larger extent, and indeed so full of
incongruities and barbarisms, that we appear a distracted city to
foreigners, who do not comprehend the meaning of such enormous outcries.
Milk is generally sold in a note above <i>Ela</i>, and it sounds so exceedingly
shrill, that it often sets our teeth on edge. The chimney-sweeper is
confined to no certain pitch; he sometimes utters himself in the deepest
bass, and sometimes in the sharpest treble; sometimes in the highest, and
sometimes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> lowest note of the gamut. The same observation might be
made on the retailers of small coal, not to mention broken glasses or
brick-dust. In these therefore, and the like cases, it should be my care
to sweeten and mellow the voices of these itinerant tradesmen, before they
make their appearance in our streets, as also to accommodate their cries
to their respective wares; and to take care in particular, that those may
not make the most noise who have the least to sell, which is very
observable in the venders of card matches, to whom I cannot but apply that
old proverb of <i>Much cry, but little wool</i>.</p>

<p>Some of these last mentioned musicians are so very loud in the sale of
these trifling manufactures, that an honest splenetic gentleman of my
acquaintance bargained with one of them never to come into the street
where he lived; but what was the effect of this contract? Why, the whole
tribe of card-match-makers which frequent that quarter, passed by his door
the very next day, in hopes of being bought off after the same manner.</p>

<p>It is another great imperfection in our London-cries, that there is no
just time nor measure observed in them. Our news should indeed be
published in a very quick time, because it is a commodity that will not
keep cold. It should not, however, be cried with the same precipitation as
fire; yet this is generally the case: a bloody battle arms the town from
one end to another in an instant. Every motion of the French is published
in so great a hurry, that one would think the enemy were at our gates.
This likewise I would take upon me to regulate in such a manner, that
there should be some distinction made between the spreading of a victory,
a march, or an encampment, a Dutch, a Portugal, or a Spanish mail. Nor
must I omit, under this head, those excessive alarms with which several
boisterous rustics infest our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> streets in turnip-season; and which are
more inexcusable, because these are wares which are in no danger of
cooling upon their hands.</p>

<p>There are others who affect a very slow time, and are, in my opinion, much
more tunable than the former; the cooper in particular swells his last
note in a hollow voice, that is not without its harmony; nor can I forbear
being inspired with a most agreeable melancholy, when I hear that sad and
solemn air with which the public are very often asked, If they have any
chairs to mend? Your own memory may suggest to you many other lamentable
ditties of the same nature, in which music is wonderfully languishing and
melodious.</p>

<p>I am always pleased with that particular time of the year which is proper
for the pickling of dill and cucumbers; but alas! this cry, like the song
of the nightingale, is not heard above two months. It would therefore be
worth while to consider, whether the same air might not in some cases be
adapted to other words.</p>

<p>It might likewise deserve our most serious consideration, how far, in a
well-regulated city, those humourists are to be tolerated, who, not
content with the traditional cries of their forefathers, have invented
particular songs and tunes of their own: such as was not many years since,
the pastry-man, commonly known by the name of the Colly-Molly-Puff; and
such as is at this day the vender of powder and wash-ball, who, if I am
rightly informed, goes under the name of <i>Powder-Watt</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img094.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Colly-Molly-Puff.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>I must not here omit one particular absurdity which runs through this
whole vociferous generation, and which renders their cries very often not
only incommodious, but altogether useless to the public; I mean that idle
accomplishment which they all of them aim at, of crying so as not to be
understood. Whether or no they have learned this from several of our
affected singers, I will not take upon me to say; but most certain it is,
that people know the wares they deal in rather by their tunes than by
their words: insomuch that I have sometimes seen a country boy run out to
buy apples of a bellows-mender, and ginger-bread from a grinder of knives
and scissors. Nay, so strangely infatuated are some very eminent artists
of this particular grace in a cry, that none but their acquaintance are
able to guess at their profession; for who else can know, <i>that work if I
had it</i>, should be the signification of a corn-cutter.</p>

<p>Forasmuch, therefore, as persons of this rank are seldom men of genius or
capacity, I think it would be very proper, that some man of good sense and
sound judgment should preside over these public cries, who should permit
none to lift up their voices in our streets, that have not tunable
throats, and are not only able to overcome the noise of the crowd, and the
rattling of coaches, but also to vend their respective merchandises in apt
phrases, and in the most distinct and agreeable sounds. I do therefore
humbly recommend myself as a person rightly qualified for this post; and
if I meet with fitting encouragement, shall communicate some other
projects which I have by me, that may no less conduce to the emolument of
the public.</p>

which the progress of society has entirely superseded, and those which
even the most advanced civilization is compelled to retain. We here only
hastily glance at a few of these differences.</p>

<p>Of the street trades which are past and forgotten, the small-coal-man was
one of the most remarkable. He tells the tale of a city with few fires;
for who could now imagine a man earning a living by bawling &#8220;<i>Small
Coals</i>&#8221; from door to door, without any supply but that in the sack which
he carries on his shoulders? His cry had, however, a rival in that of
&#8220;<i>Any Wood to cleave</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here we must pause awhile to make a passing remark&mdash;even if it be no
more than a mere wayside nod to the memory of Thomas Britton, the
celebrated &#8220;Musical Small Coal Man,&#8221;&mdash;1654-1714.&mdash;to whom Britain is
greatly indebted for the introduction and cultivation of concerted music,
and whose influence has been indirectly felt in musical circles throughout
the world:&mdash;</p>

<p>This singular man had a small coal shop at the corner of a passage in

<p>Every stationer&#8217;s or general-shop can now supply all the &#8220;<i>Fine
Writing-ink</i>,&#8221; wanted either by clerks or authors. There is a grocer&#8217;s
shop, or co-operative store at every turn; and who therefore needs him who
cried aloud &#8220;<i>Lilly white Vinegar, three-pence a quart</i>?&#8221; When everybody,
old and young, wore wigs&mdash;when the price for a common one was a guinea,
and a journeyman had a new one every year; when it was an article in every
city apprentice&#8217;s indenture that his master should find him in &#8220;One good
and sufficent wig, yearly, and every year, for, and during, and unto the
expiration of the full end and term of his apprenticeship&#8221;&mdash;then, a
wig-seller made his stand in the street, or called from door to door, and
talked of a &#8220;<i>Fine Tie, or a fine Bob-wig sir?</i>&#8221; Formerly, women cried
&#8220;<i>Four pair for a shilling, Holland Socks</i>,&#8221; also &#8220;<i>Long Thread Laces,
long and strong</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>Scotch or Russian Cloth</i>,&#8221; &#8220;<i>Buy any Wafers or Wax</i>.&#8221;
&#8220;<i>London&#8217;s Gazette, here?</i>&#8221; The history of cries is a history of social
changes. Many of the <i>working</i> trades, as well as the vendors of things
that can be bought in every shop, are now nearly banished from our
thoroughfares. &#8220;<i>Old Chairs to mend</i>,&#8221; or &#8220;<i>A brass Pot or an iron Pot to
mend?</i>&#8221; still salutes us in some retired suburb; and we still see the
knife-grinder&#8217;s wheel; but who vociferates &#8220;<i>Any work for John Cooper?</i>&#8221;
The trades are gone to those who pay scot and lot. What should we think of
prison discipline, now-a-days, if the voice of lamentation was heard in
every street, &#8220;<i>Some Bread and Meat for the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> Prisoners; for the
Lord&#8217;s sake, pity the Poor</i>?&#8221; John Howard put down this cry. Or what
should we say of the vigilance of excise-officers if the cry of &#8220;<i>Aqua
Vit&aelig;</i>&#8221; met our ears? The Chiropodist has now his guinea, a country villa,
and railway season ticket; in the old days he stood at corners, with knife
and scissors in hand, crying &#8220;<i>Corns to pick</i>.&#8221; There are some occupations
of the streets, however, which remain essentially the same, though the
form be somewhat varied. The sellers of food are of course among these.
&#8220;<i>Hot Peascod</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Hot Sheep&#8217;s-feet</i>,&#8221; are not popular delicacies, as
in the time of Lydgate. &#8220;<i>Hot Wardens</i>,&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Hot Codlings</i>,&#8221; are not the
cries which invite us to taste of stewed pears and baked apples. But we
have still apples hissing over a charcoal fire; also roasted chesnuts, and
potatoes steaming in a shining apparatus, with savoury salt-butter to put
between the &#8220;fruit&#8221; when cut; the London pieman still holds his ground in
spite of the many penny pie-shops now established. Rice-milk is yet sold
out in halfpennyworths. But furmety, barley broth, greasy sausages&mdash;&#8220;bags
of mystery,&#8221; redolent of onions and marjoram&mdash;crisp brown flounders, and
saloop are no longer in request.</p>

<p>The cry of &#8220;<i>Water-cresses</i>&#8221; used to be heard from some barefoot nymph of
the brook, who at sunrise had dipped her foot into the bubbling runnel, to
carry the green luxury to the citizens&#8217; breakfast-tables. Water-cresses
are now cultivated, like cabbages, in market-gardens. The cry of
&#8220;<i>Rosemary and Briar</i>&#8221; once resounded through the throughfares; and every
alley smelt &#8220;like Bucklersbury in simple time,&#8221; when the whole street was
a mart for odoriferous herbs. Cries like these are rare enough now; yet we
do hear them occasionally, when crossing some bye-street, and have then
smelt an unwonted fragrance in the air; and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> someone has truly said

a feeble voice, cries &#8220;<i>Buy my sweet Briar, any Rosemary?</i>&#8221; There are

crowded and fashionable thoroughfares, who present the passengers with
moss-roses, and violets. Gay tells us:&mdash;</p>

<p>This was formerly a very popular London cry, but has now become extinct,
although it was long kept in vogue by reason of the old prejudices of old
fashioned people, whose sympathy was with the complaints of the
water-bearer, who daily vociferated in and about the environs of London,
&#8220;Any fresh and fair spring water here! none of your pipe sludge?&#8221;&mdash;though
their own old tubs were often not particularly nice and clean to look at,
and the water was likely to receive various impurities in being carried
along the streets in all weathers.&mdash;&#8220;Ah dear?&#8221; cried his customers, &#8220;Ah
dear! Well, what&#8217;ll the world come to!&mdash;they won&#8217;t let poor people live at
all by-and-bye&mdash;Ah dear! here they are breaking up all the roads and

all their fine new fandangle goings on, but I&#8217;ll stick to the poor old
lame and nearly blind water-carrier, as my old father did before me, as
long as he has a pailful and I&#8217;ve a penny, and when we haven&#8217;t we must go
to the workhouse together.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the talk and reasoning of many honest people of that day, who
preferred taxing themselves, to the daily payment of a penny and very
often twopence to the water-carrier, in preference to having &#8220;<i>Company&#8217;s
water</i>&#8221; at a fixed or <i>pro-rata</i> sum per annum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Colebrooke Row was built in 1708. Here Charles Lamb, resided with his
sister Mary, from 1823 to 1826; during which period&mdash;viz, on Tuesday, the
29th March, 1825, he closed his thirty-three years&#8217; clerkship at the East
India House. Lamb very graphically describes the event in a letter to
Bernard Barton, dated September 2, 1823, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When you come Londonward, you will find me no longer in Covent
Garden; I have a cottage in Colebrooke Row, Islington&mdash;a cottage, for
it is detached&mdash;a white house, with six good rooms in it. The New
River (rather elderly by this time) runs (if a moderate walking-pace
can be so termed) close to the foot of the house; and behind is a
spacious garden, with vines (I assure you), pears, strawberries,
parsnips, leeks, carrots, cabbages, to delight the heart of old
Alcinous. You enter without passage into a cheerful dining-room, all
studded over and rough with old books; and above is a lightsome
drawing-room, three windows, full of choice prints. I feel like a
great lord, never having had a house before.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>And again, in the November following, in a letter to Robert Southey, he
informs the bard, who had promised him a call, that he is &#8220;at Colebrooke
Cottage, left hand coming from Sadler&#8217;s Wells.&#8221; It was here that that
amiable bookworm, George Dyer, editor of the Delphin Classics, walked
quietly into the New River from Charles Lamb&#8217;s door, but was soon
recovered, thanks to the kind care of Miss Lamb.</p>

intimate with Goodman Symes, the then tenant-keeper of the Tower, and

pleasure in entertaining him in the antique panelled chamber where
Goldsmith wrote his <i>Traveller</i>, and supped frugally on buttermilk; and in
pointing to a small portrait of Shakespeare, in a curiously carved gilt
frame, which Lamb would look at longingly. He was never weary of toiling
up and down the winding and narrow stairs of this suburban pile, and

<p>Time and circumstances have effectually disposed of the water-carrier, his
occupation is gone, it is impossible London can ever again see a man bent
beneath the weight of a yoke and two enormous pails, vociferating &#8220;<i>Any
fresh and fair Spring Water here?</i>&#8221; But the cry of &#8220;Milk,&#8221; or the rattle
of the milk-pail will never cease to be heard in our streets. There can be
no reservoirs of milk, no pipes through which it flows into the houses.
The more extensive the great capital becomes, the more active must be the
individual exertion to carry about this article of food. The old cry was
&#8220;<i>Any Milk here?</i>&#8221; and it was sometimes mingled with the sound of &#8220;<i>Fresh
Cheese and Cream</i>;&#8221; and it then passed into &#8220;<i>Milk, maids below</i>;&#8221; and it
was then shortened into &#8220;<i>Milk below</i>;&#8221; and was finally corrupted into
&#8220;<i>Mio</i>,&#8221; which some wag interpreted into <i>mi-eau</i>&mdash;<i>demi-eau</i>&mdash;half water.
But it must still be cried, whatever be the cry. The supply of milk to the
metropolis is perhaps one of the most beautiful combinations of industry
we have. The days have long since passed when Finsbury had its pleasant
groves, and Clerkenwell was a village, and there were green pastures in
Holborn, when St. Pancras boasted only a little church standing in
meadows, and St. Martin&#8217;s was literally in the fields. Slowly but surely
does the baked clay of Mr. Jerry, &#8220;the speculative builder&#8221; stride over
the clover and the buttercup; and yet every family in London may be
supplied with milk by eight o&#8217;clock every morning at their own doors.
Where do the cows abide? They are congregated in wondrous herds in the
suburbs; and though in spring-time they go out to pasture in the fields
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> lie under the Hampstead and Highgate hills, or in the vales of
Dulwich and Sydenham, and there crop the tender blade,&mdash;</p>

<p>yet for the rest of the year the coarse grass is carted to their stalls,
or they devour what the breweries and distilleries cannot extract from the
grain harvest. Long before &#8220;the unfolding star wakes up the shepherd&#8221; are
the London cows milked; and the great wholesale vendors of the commodity,
who have it consigned to them daily from more distant parts to the various
railway stations in the metropolis, bear it in carts to every part of the
town, and distribute it to the hundreds of shopkeepers and itinerants, who
are anxiously waiting to receive it for re-distribution amongst their own
customers. It is evident that a perishable commodity which everyone
requires at a given hour, must be so distributed. The distribution has
lost its romance. Misson, in his &#8220;Travels&#8221; published at the beginning of
the last century, tells of May-games of the London milkmaids thus:&mdash;&#8220;On
the first of May, and the five or six days following, all the pretty young
country girls that serve the town with milk, dress themselves up very
neatly, and borrow abundance of Silver-Plate, whereof they make a pyramid,
which they adorn with ribbons and flowers, and carry upon their heads,
instead of their common milk pails. In this equipage, accompanied with
some of their fellow milkmaids, and a bagpipe or fiddle, they go from door
to door, dancing before the houses of their customers, in the midst of
boys and girls that follow them in troops, and everybody gives them
something.&#8221; Alas! the May-games and pretty young country girls have both
departed, and a milk-woman has become a very unpoetical personage. There
are few indeed of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>milkwomen who remain. So it is with most of the
occupations that associate London with the country.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago there appeared in the &#8220;Quarterly Review&#8221; a remarkable
article on the Commissariat of London, from the pen of Dr. Andrew Wynter.
In it we were told for how many miles the beasts brought annually to the
metropolis would stretch, if ranged ten abreast in a seemingly
interminable column. In order to convey some notion of the stupendous
quantities of ale, beer, and porter consumed, Dr. Wynter fixed upon Hyde
Park as his exhibition ground, and piled together all the barrels
containing the malt liquor drunk by what, in 1854, was a population of two
million and a half souls. He came to the conclusion that these barrels
would form a thousand columns not far short of a mile in perpendicular
height. And among other statistics, Dr. Wynter calculated that there were
at that time about twenty thousand cows in the metropolitan and suburban
dairies, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> of which establishments contained five hundred cows apiece.
He also noticed that, the London and suburban dairies could not alone
supply the population of the metropolis, seeing that twenty thousand cows,
giving on an average twelve quarts each per diem, would not yield more
than two hundred and forty thousand quarts. If we suppose this quantity
increased by the iron-tailed cow to three hundred thousand quarts, the
allowance to each of the two millions and a half of human beings then
living within the Bills of Mortality would be about a quarter of a pint
per head. The &#8220;Quarterly&#8221; Reviewer, therefore, assumed that, to meet the
existing demands of the tea-table, the nursery, and the kitchen, half as
much again as three hundred thousand quarts was consumed annually in
London. For this excess he looked to the country to supplement the efforts
of the metropolis and of its suburbs as suppliers of milk, and noticed
that the precious white liquid was brought daily to London from farms
lying as far away as eighty miles from the metropolitan railway stations
to which it was consigned.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img107.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Nothing can be more instructive and entertaining than to turn back in 1884
to facts, figures, calculations, estimates, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> inferences which fitted
the London of 1854. Instead of two millions and a half, the population
resident at this moment within the metropolitan and city police districts
amounts at least to four millions and three-quarters. The area already
covered by the mighty town, which adds another big town to its entirety
each successive year, is about four hundred and fifty thousand square
acres, and there are more than seven hundred thousand houses to be
provided for, of which it may be presumed that few can do without at least
a pint of milk per diem. Assuming, however, that each member of this
enormous population consumed no more than a quarter of a pint of
milk&mdash;that is to say, a small tumblerful&mdash;per diem, we come to the
astounding conclusion that nearly six hundred thousand quarts are wanted
every day, nearly four million two hundred thousand quarts every week, and
nearly two hundred and seventeen million quarts every year, to meet the
demands of London. Few of us are able to fathom the meaning of two hundred
million quarts of liquid until we are told what an immense reservoir, ten
feet deep, it would take to hold such an amount. More intelligible are the
calculations which tell us that, assuming a cow to yield ten&mdash;not
twelve&mdash;quarts of milk daily, it would require nearly sixty thousand milch
cows to maintain this supply from year&#8217;s end to year&#8217;s end. If these
patient and valuable milkers are estimated as being worth no more than
twenty-pounds apiece, they would represent in their aggregate a capital of
little less than one million four hundred thousand pounds. Pure milk of a
reliable character, costs five-pence per quart, and therefore, on the
above basis, there is spent on milk, in the metropolis and its
circumjacent districts, twelve thousand four hundred pounds per day,
nearly eighty-seven thousand pounds per week, and considerably more than
four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> and a half million pounds per annum. There are States which have
made a considerable noise in the world, whose total revenue does not reach
what London spends annually in milk alone. As for the distribution of this
inconceivable amount of liquid, which is delivered every morning and
afternoon in small quantities all over the enormous area of
bricks-and-mortar to which we have referred, it would utterly baffle the
most marvellous organiser and administrator that ever existed upon earth,
to extemporise human machinery for carrying on so minute and yet so
gigantic a trade. Nevertheless, how smoothly and imperceptibly, not only
in this one small detail, but throughout the whole of its vast and endless
complications and ramifications, does the commissariat of London work! We
are told, for instance, that to distribute every sixteen gallons of milk
one person is necessary, and that, without counting managers, clerks,
shopmen and shopwomen, nearly five thousand human beings, assisted by more
than fifteen hundred horses and mules, are needed to furnish London with
milk every twenty-four hours. More than a quarter of a million pounds go
yearly in wages to milkmen and milkwomen with whom we are all so familiar,
and who will doubtless, acquire additional importance in the eyes of those
who reflect that these humble servitors are but, in Pope&#8217;s words, &#8220;parts
of that stupendous whole&#8221; without whose useful, patient, and unintermitted
labours the faultless machinery of the grandest camp of men that ever yet
existed would instantly stand still.</p>

<p>Then it must not be forgotten that the milk trade exacts constant and
unintermitted work from its employ&eacute;s&mdash;work from which neither Sundays nor
holidays bring any relief&mdash;and demanding very early rising in the morning,
to say nothing of the greatest personal cleanliness, and of an immense
array of cans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> varying from those capable of holding many gallons down to
those which contain no more than half-a-pint&mdash;the milk-pail and its daily
history might well attract notice from writers not inferior in grasp and
imagination to Defoe or Dickens. In 1854 Dr. Wynter calculated that, as
regards distribution, the commissariat of London was carried on by an army
of one hundred thousand persons. In thirty years the population has all
but doubled, and the machinery of distribution has been so improved that
its working at present approaches very nearly to perfection. This
perfection is due solely to freedom of trade and to universal competition,
which so nicely adjust all the varying conditions of life, that, in
serving themselves, they accomplish more than all the Governments on earth
could effect by the most ingenious system of centralisation that human wit
could devise.</p>

accompanied by a loud blast of a long tin-horn, which announced to the

Howe, Hood, Nelson, or Wellington. A copy of the &#8220;Gazette&#8221; or newspaper

and there are now penalties, with police constables to enforce them,
against &#8220;All persons blowing any horn or using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> any other noisy

<p>&#8220;About thirty years before the cry of &#8216;Clean your boots, sir!&#8217; became
familiar to the ears of the present generation of Londoners,&#8221; Mr. Charles
Knight informs us that:&mdash;&#8220;In one of the many courts on the north side of
Fleet-street, might be seen, somewhere about the year 1820, &#8216;The last of
the London shoe-blacks.&#8217; One would think that he deemed himself dedicated
to his profession by Nature, for he was a Negro. At the earliest dawn he
crept forth from his neighbouring lodging, and planted his tripod on the
quiet pavement, where he patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> stood till noon was past. He was a
short, large-headed son of Africa, subject, as it would appear, to
considerable variations of spirits, alternating between depression and
excitement, as the gains of the day presented to him the chance of having
a few pence to recreate himself beyond what he should carry home to his
wife and children. For he had a wife and children, this last
representative of a falling trade; and two or three little woolly-headed
<i>d&eacute;crotteurs</i> nestled around him when he was idle, or assisted in taking
off the roughest of the dirt when he had more than one client. He watched,
with a melancholy eye, the gradual improvement of the streets; for during
some twenty or thirty years he had beheld all the world combining to ruin
him. He saw the foot pavements widening; the large flag-stones carefully
laid down; the loose and broken piece, which discharged a slushy shower on
the unwary foot, and known to him and London chairmen as a
&#8216;<i>Beau-trap</i>&#8217;<a name='fna_11' id='fna_11' href='#f_11'><small>[11]</small></a> instantly removed: he saw the kennels diligently
cleansed, and the drains widened: he saw experiment upon experiment made
in the repair of the carriage-way, and the holes, which were to him as the
&#8216;old familiar faces&#8217; which he loved, filled up with a haste that appeared
quite unnecessary, if not insulting. One solitary country shopkeeper, who
had come to London once a year during a long life, clung to our sable
friend; for he was the only one of the fraternity that he could find
remaining, in his walk from Charing-cross to Cheapside.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Hone, in &#8220;<i>The Table Book</i>,&#8221; 1827, under an article on the Old London
cries has:&mdash;&#8220;A Shoeblack; A boy, with a small basket beside him, brushes a
shoe on a stone, and addresses himself to a wigged beau, who carries his
cocked hat under his left arm, with a crooked-headed walking stick in his
left hand, as was the fashion among the dandies of old times. I recollect
shoeblacks formerly at the corner of almost every street, especially in
great thoroughfares. There were several every morning on the steps of St.
Andrew&#8217;s church, Holborn, till late in the forenoon. But the greatest
exhibition of these artists was on the site of Finsbury-square, when it
was an open field, and a depository for the stones used in paving and
street-masonry. There, a whole army of shoeblacks intercepted the citizens
and their clerks on their way from Islington and Hoxton to the
counting-houses and shops in the city, with &#8216;Shoeblack, your honour! Black
your shoes, sir!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Each of them had a large, old tin-kettle, containing his apparatus,
viz:&mdash;a capacious pipkin, or other large earthen-pot, containing the
blacking, which was made of ivory-black, the coarsest moist sugar, and
pure water with a little vinegar&mdash;a knife, two or three brushes, and an
old wig. The old wig was an indispensable requisite to a shoeblack; it
whisked away the dust, or thoroughly wiped off the wet dirt, which his
knife and brushes could not entirely detach; a rag tied to the end of a
stick smeared his viscid blacking on the shoe, and if the blacking was
&#8220;real japan,&#8221; it shone. The old experienced shoe-wearers preferred an
oleaginous, lustreless blacking. A more liquid blacking, which took a
polish from the brush, was of later use and invention. Nobody at that time
wore boots except on horseback; and everybody wore breeches and
stockings:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> pantaloons, or trousers, were unheard of. The old shoeblacks
operated on the shoes while they were on the feet, and so dexterously as
not to soil the fine white cotton stocking, which was at that time the
extreme of fashion, or to smear the buckles, which were universally worn.
Latterly, you were accommodated with an old pair of shoes to stand in, and
the yesterday&#8217;s paper to read, while your shoes were cleaning and
polishing, and your buckles were whitened and brushed. When shoestrings
first came into vogue, the Prince of Wales (Geo. IV.) appeared with them
in his shoes, when immediately a deputation from the buckle-makers of
Birmingham presented a petition to his Royal Highness to resume the
wearing of buckles, which was good-naturedly complied with. Yet, in a
short time, shoestrings entirely superseded buckles. The first incursion
on the shoeblacks was by the makers of &#8220;Patent Cake Blacking&#8221; on sticks
formed with a handle, like a small battledoor; they suffered a more
fearful invasion from the makers of liquid blacking in bottles. Soon
afterwards, when &#8220;Day and Martin&#8221; manufactured the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of
blacking, private shoeblacking became general, public shoeblacks rapidly
disappeared, and in [1827] they became extinct. The last shoeblack that I
remember in London sat under the covered entrance of Red Lion-court,
Fleet-street within the last six years. This unfortunate, &#8220;The Last of the
London Shoeblacks&#8221;&mdash;was probably the &#8220;short, large headed son of Africa&#8221;
alluded to by Charles Knight, under the heading of &#8220;Clean your honour&#8217;s
shoes,&#8221; in his &#8220;History of London.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1851, some gentlemen connected with the Ragged Schools determined to
revive the brotherhood of boot cleaners for the convenience of the foreign
visitors to the Exhibition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> commenced the experiment by sending out
five boys in the now well-known red uniform. The scheme succeeded beyond
expection; the boys were patronized by natives as well as aliens, and the
Shoeblack Society and its brigade were regularly organized. During the
exhibition season, about twenty-five boys were constantly employed, and
cleaned no less than 100,000 pairs of boots. The receipts of the brigade
during its first year amounted to &pound;656. Since that time, thanks to the
combination of discipline and liberality, the Shoeblack Society has gone
on and prospered, and proved the Parent of other Societies. Every district
in London now has its corps of shoeblacks, in every variety of uniform,
and while the number of boys has increased from tens to hundreds, their
earnings have increased from hundreds to thousands. Numbers of London
waifs and strays have been rescued from idleness and crime. The Ragged
School Union, and Shoeblack Brigades, therefore hold a prominent place
among the indirectly preventive agencies for the suppression of crime: for
since ignorance is generally the parent of vice, any means of securing the
benefits of education to those who are hopelessly deprived of it, must
operate in favour of the well-being of society.</p>

&#8220;<i>Jemmy</i>,&#8221; or, &#8220;<i>Old Jemmy</i>&#8221;
Catnach, (<i>Kat-nak</i>,) late of the Seven Dials, London, printer and
publisher of ballads, battledores, lotteries, primers, &amp;c., and whose name
is ever associated with the literature of the streets, was the son of John
Catnach, a printer, of Alnwick, an ancient borough, market town, and
parish of Northumberland, where he was born on August 18th, 1792.</p>

<p>At the time Jemmy Catnach commenced business in Seven Dials it took all
the prudence and tact which he could command to maintain his position, as
at that time &#8220;Johnny&#8221; Pitts,<a name='fna_12' id='fna_12' href='#f_12'><small>[12]</small></a> of the Toy and Marble Warehouse, No. 6,
Great St. Andrew-street, was the acknowledged and established printer of
street literature for the &#8220;Dials&#8221; district; therefore, as may be easily
imagined, a powerful rivalry and vindictive jealousy soon arose between
these &#8220;two of a trade&#8221;&mdash;most especially on the part of &#8220;Old Mother&#8221; Pitts,
who is described as being a coarse and vulgar-minded personage, and as
having originally followed the trade of a bumboat woman at Portsmouth: she
&#8220;wowed wengeance&#8221; against the young fellow in the court for daring to set
up in their business, and also spoke of him as a young &#8220;Catsnatch,&#8221;
&#8220;Catblock,&#8221; &#8220;Cut-throat;&#8221; many other opprobrious terms being also freely
given to the new comer. Pitts&#8217; staff of &#8220;bards&#8221; were duly cautioned of the
consequences which would inevitably follow should they dare to write a
line for Catnach&mdash;the new <i>cove</i> in the court. The injunction was for a
time obeyed, but the &#8220;Seven Bards of the Seven Dials&#8221; soon found it not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
only convenient, but also more profitable to sell copies of their
effusions to both sides at the same time, and by keeping their council
they avoided detection, as each printer accused the other of buying an
early sold copy, and then reprinting it off with the utmost speed, and
which was in reality often the case, as &#8220;Both Houses&#8221; had emissaries on
the constant look-out for any new production suitable for street-sale.
Now, although this style of &#8220;double dealing&#8221; and competition tended much
to lessen the cost price to the &#8220;middle-man,&#8221; or vendor, the public in
this case did not get any of the reduction, as a penny broadside was still
a penny, and a quarter-sheet still a halfpenny to them, the
&#8220;street-patterer&#8221; obtaining the whole of the reduction as extra profit.</p>

<p>The feud existing between these rival publishers, who have been somewhat
aptly designated as the Colburn and Bentley of the &#8220;paper&#8221; trade, never
abated, but, on the contrary, increased in acrimony of temper until at
last not being content to vilify each other by words alone, they resorted
to printing off virulent lampoons, in which Catnach never failed to let
the world know that &#8220;Old Mother Pitts&#8221; had been formerly a bumboat woman,

of barbarity. The poor victim was a servant girl, whom under pretense
of marriage he seduced. On her proving with child the villain formed

Aloud for mercy she did call,<br />
Her cries did rend the air;<br />
With clasped hands and uplift eyes<br />
She cried, Oh spare my life,<br />
I never more will ask you<br />
To make me your wedded wife.<br />
O then this wicked young man said,<br />
No mercy will I show;<br />
He took the knife all from his side,<br />
And pierced her body through.<br />
But still she smiling said to him,<br />
While trembling with fear,<br />
A&auml;! William, William, spare my life,<br />
Think on your baby dear.<br />
Twice more then with the bloody knife<br />
He ran her body through,<br />
Her throat was cut from ear to ear,<br />
Most dreadful for to view;<br />
Her hands and arms and beauteous face<br />
He cut and mangled sore,<br />
While down upon her milk white breast<br />
The crimson blood did pour.<br />
He took the shawl from off her neck,<br />
And round her body tied,<br />
With pebble stones he did it fill,<br />
Thinking the crime to hide.<br />
O then into the silver stream<br />
He plunged her straightway,<br />
But with her precious blood was stained,<br />
Which soon did him betray.<br />
O then this young man taken was,<br />
And into prison sent,<br />
In ratling chains he is confin&#8217;d<br />
His crime for to lament,<br />
Until the Asizes do come on<br />
When trembling he must stand,<br />
Reflecting on the deed he&#8217;s done;<br />
Waiting the dread command.<br />
Now all you thoughtless young men<br />
A timely warning take;<br />
Likewise ye fair young maidens,<br />
For this poor damsel&#8217;s sake.<br />
And Oh beware of flattering tongues,<br />
For they&#8217;ll your ruin prove;<br />
So may you crown your future day,<br />
In comfort, joy, and love.</td></tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>There can be little doubt that Catnach, the great publisher of the Seven
Dials, next to children&#8217;s books, had his mind mostly centred upon the
chronicling of doubtful scandals, fabulous duels between ladies of
fashion, &#8220;cooked&#8221; assassinations, and sudden deaths of eminent
individuals, apochryphal elopements, real or catch-penny accounts of
murders, impossible robberies, delusive suicides, dark deeds and public
executions, to which was usually attached the all-important and necessary
&#8220;Sorrowful Lamentations,&#8221; or &#8220;Copy of Affectionate Verses,&#8221; which,
according to the established custom, the criminal composed in the
condemned cell the night before his execution, after this manner:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;All you that have got feeling hearts, I pray you now attend<br />
To these few lines so sad and true, a solemn silence lend;<br />
It is of a cruel murder, to you I will unfold&mdash;&mdash;<br />
The bare recital of the tale must make your blood run cold.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>Or take another and stereotyped example, which from time to time has
served equally well for the verses <i>written by</i> the culprit&mdash;Brown, Jones,
Robinson, or Smith:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fixed is my fate.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>Occasionally the Last Sorrowful Lamentations contained a &#8220;Love
Letter&#8221;&mdash;the criminal being unable, in some instances, to read or write,
being no obstacle to the composition&mdash;written according to the street
patterer&#8217;s statement: &#8220;from the depths of the condemned cell, with the
condemned pen, ink, and paper.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> This mode of procedure in &#8220;gallows&#8221;
literature, and this style of composition having prevailed for from sixty
to seventy years.</p>

<p>Then they would say: &#8220;Here you have also an exact likeness of the
murderer, taken at the bar of the Old Bailey by an eminent artist!&#8221; when
all the time it was an old woodcut that had been used for every criminal
for many years.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing beats a stunning good murder after all,&#8221; said a &#8220;running
patterer&#8221; to Mr. Henry Mayhew, the author of &#8220;London Labour and London
Poor.&#8221; It is only fair to assume that Mr. James Catnach shared in the
sentiment, for it is said that he made over &pound;500 by the publication of:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Full, True and Particular Account of the Murder of Mr. Weare by John
Thurtell and his Companions, which took place on the 24th of October,
1823, in Gill&#8217;s Hill-lane, near Elstree, in Hertfordshire:&mdash;Only One
Penny.&#8221; There were eight formes set up, for old Jemmy had no notion of
stereotyping in those days, and pressmen had to re-cover their own
sheep-skins. But by working night and day for a week they managed to get
off about 250,000 copies with the four presses, each working two formes at
a time.</p>

<p>As the trial progressed, and the case became more fully developed, the
public mind became almost insatiable. Every night and morning large
bundles were despatched to the principal towns in the three kingdoms.</p>

<p>One of the many street-ballads on the subject informed the British public

<span class="giant">JOHN THURTELL</span><br />
<img src="images/img119.jpg" alt="AT HERTFORD GAOL," /><br />
On Friday, the 9th of January, 1824.</p>

<p class="center"><br />THE EXECUTION.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Hertford, half-past twelve o&#8217;clock.</i></p>

<p>This morning, at ten minutes before twelve, a bustle among the
javelin-men stationed within the boarded enclosure on which the drop
was erected, announced to the multitude without that the preparations
for the execution were nearly concluded. The javelin-men proceeded to
arrange themselves in the order usually observed upon these melancholy
but necessary occurrences. They had scarcely finished their
arrangements, when the opening of the gate of the prison gave an
additional impulse to public anxiety.</p>

<p>When the clock was on the stroke of twelve, Mr Nicholson, the
Under-Sheriff, and the executioner ascended the platform, followed on
to it by Thurtell, who mounted the stairs with a slow but steady step.
The principal turnkey of the gaol came next, and was followed by Mr
Wilson and two officers. On the approach of the prisoner being
intimated by those persons who, being in an elevated situation,
obtained the first view of him, all the immense multitude present took
off their hats.</p>

<p>Thurtell immediately placed himself under the fatal beam, and at that
moment the chimes of a neighbouring clock began to strike twelve. The
executioner then came forward with the rope, which he threw across it.
Thurtell first lifted his eyes up to the drop, gazed at it for a few
moments, and then took a calm but hurried survey of the multitude
around him. He next fixed his eyes on a young gentleman in the crowd,
whom he had frequently seen as a spectator at the commencement of the
proceedings against him. Seeing that the individual was affected by
the circumstance, he removed them to another quarter, and in so doing
recognised an individual well known in the sporting circles, to whom
he made a slight bow.</p>

<p>The prisoner was attired in a dark brown great coat, with a black
velvet collar, white corduroy breeches, drab gaiters and shoes. His
hands were confined with handcuffs, instead of being tied with cord,
as is usually the case on such occasions, and, at his own request, his
arms were not pinioned. He wore a pair of black kid gloves, and the
wrists of his shirt were visible below the cuffs of his coat. As on
the last day of his trial, he wore a white cravat. The irons, which
were very heavy, and consisted of a succession of chain links, were
still on his legs, and were held up in the middle by a Belcher
handkerchief tied round his waist.</p>

<p>The executioner commenced his mournful duties by taking from the
unhappy prisoner his cravat and collar. To obviate all difficulty in
this stage of the proceedings, Thurtell flung back his head and neck,
and so gave the executioner an opportunity of immediately divesting
him of that part of his dress. After tying the rope round Thurtell&#8217;s
neck, the executioner drew a white cotton cap over his countenance,
which did not, however, conceal the contour of his face, or deprive
him entirely of the view of surrounding objects.</p>

<p>At that moment the clock sounded the last stroke of twelve. During the
whole of this appalling ceremony, there was not the slightest symptom
of emotion discernible in his features; his demeanour was perfectly
calm and tranquil, and he behaved like a man acquainted with the
dreadful ordeal he was about to pass, but not unprepared to meet it.
Though his fortitude was thus conspicuous, it was evident from his
appearance that in the interval between his conviction and his
execution he must have suffered much. He looked careworn; his
countenance had assumed a cadaverous hue, and there was a haggardness
and lankness about his cheeks and mouth, which could not fail to
attract the notice of every spectator.</p>

<p>The executioner next proceeded to adjust the noose by which Thurtell
was to be attached to the scaffold. After he had fastened it in such a
manner as to satisfy his own mind, Thurtell looked up at it, and
examined it with great attention. He then desired the executioner to
let him have fall enough. The rope at this moment seemed as if it
would only give a fall of two or three feet. The executioner assured
him that the fall was quite sufficient. The principal turnkey then
went up to Thurtell, shook hands with him, and turned away in tears.
Mr Wilson, the governor of the gaol, next approached him. Thurtell
said to him, &#8220;Do you think, Mr Wilson, I have got enough fall?&#8221; Mr
Wilson replied, &#8220;I think you have, Sir. Yes, quite enough.&#8221; Mr Wilson
then took hold of his hand, shook it, and said, &#8220;Good bye, Mr
Thurtell, may God Almighty bless you.&#8221; Thurtell instantly replied,
&#8220;God bless <i>you</i>, Mr Wilson, God bless <i>you</i>.&#8221; Mr Wilson next asked
him whether he considered that the laws of his country had been dealt
to him justly and fairly, upon which he said, &#8220;I admit that justice
has been done me&mdash;I am perfectly satisfied.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few seconds then elapsed, during which every person seemed to be
engaged in examining narrowly Thurtell&#8217;s deportment. His features, as
well as they could be discerned, appeared to remain unmoved, and his
hands, which were extremely prominent, continued perfectly steady, and
were not affected by the slightest tremulous motion.</p>

<p>Exactly at two minutes past twelve the Under-Sheriff, with his wand,
gave the dreadful signal&mdash;the drop suddenly and silently fell&mdash;and</p>

<p>Four years after the Thurtell and Weare affair, namely, in the month of
April, 1828, another &#8220;sensational&#8221; murder was discovered&mdash;that of Maria
Marten, by William Corder, in the Red Barn, at Polstead, in the county of
Suffolk. The circumstances that led to the discovery of this most
atrocious murder were of an extraordinary and romantic nature, and
manifest an almost special interposition of Providence in marking out the
offender. As the mother of the girl had on three several nights dreamt
that her daughter was murdered and buried in Corder&#8217;s Red Barn, and as
this proved to be the case, an additional &#8220;charm&#8221; was given to the
circumstance. Hence the &#8220;Catnach Press&#8221; was again set working both day and
night to meet the great demand for the &#8220;Full Particulars.&#8221; In due course
came the gratifying announcement of the apprehension of the murderer! and
the sale continued unabatingly, in both town and country, every &#8220;Flying
Stationer&#8221; making great profits by the sale.</p>

<p>The trial of Corder took place at Bury St. Edmonds, on the 7th of August,
1828, before the Lord Chief Baron (Anderson). The prisoner pleaded &#8220;<i>Not
Guilty</i>,&#8221; and the trial proceeded. On being called on for his defence,
Corder read a manuscript paper. He declared that he deeply deplored the
death of the unfortunate deceased, and he urged the jury to dismiss from
their minds all that prejudice which must necessarily have been excited
against him by the public press, &amp;c. Having concluded his address, the
Lord Chief Baron summed up, and a verdict of &#8220;<i>Guilty</i>&#8221; was returned. The
Last Dying Speech and confession had an enormous sale&mdash;estimated at
1,166,000, a <i>fac-simile</i> copy of which, with the &#8220;Lamentable Verses,&#8221;
said to have been written by Old Jemmy Catnach, will be found on the

<p>Since the tragical affair between Thurtell and Weare, no event has
occurred connected with the criminal annals of our country which has
excited so much interest as the trial of Corder, who was justly
convicted of the murder of Maria Marten on Friday last.</p>


<p class="center"><br />THE CONFESSION.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Bury Gaol, August 10th, 1828.&mdash;Condemned cell.<br />
<span style="padding-right: 2em;">&#8220;Sunday evening, half-past Eleven.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I acknowledge being guilty of the death of poor Maria Marten, by
shooting her with a pistol. The particulars are as follows:&mdash;When we
left her father&#8217;s house, we began quarrelling about the burial of the
child: she apprehended the place wherein it was deposited would be
found out. The quarrel continued about three quarters of an hour upon
this sad and about other subjects. A scuffle ensued, and during the
scuffle, and at the time I think that she had hold of me, I took the
pistol from the side pocket of my velveteen jacket and fired. She
fell, and died in an instant. I never saw her even struggle. I was
overwhelmed with agitation and dismay:&mdash;the body fell near the front
doors on the floor of the barn. A vast quantity of blood issued from
the wound, and ran on to the floor and through the crevices. Having
determined to bury the body in the barn (about two hours after she was
dead). I went and borrowed a spade of Mrs Stow, but before I went
there I dragged the body from the barn into the chaff-house, and
locked the barn. I returned again to the barn, and began to dig a
hole, but the spade being a bad one, and the earth firm and hard, I
was obliged to go home for a pickaxe and a better spade, with which I
dug the hole, and then buried the body. I think I dragged the body by
the handkerchief that was tied round her neck. It was dark when I
finished covering up the body. I went the next day, and washed the
blood from off the barn-floor. I declare to Almighty God I had no
sharp instrument about me, and no other wound but the one made by the
pistol was inflicted by me. I have been guilty of great idleness, and
at times led a dissolute life, but I hope through the mercy of God to
be forgiven. <span class="smcap">William Corder.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><br />THE EXECUTION.</p>

<p>At ten minutes before twelve o&#8217;clock the prisoner was brought from his
cell and pinioned by the hangman, who was brought from London for the
purpose. He appeared resigned, but was so weak as to be unable to
stand without support; when his cravat was removed he groaned heavily,
and appeared to be labouring under great mental agony. When his wrists
and arms were made fast, he was led round twards the scaffold, and as
he paused the different yards in which the prisoners were confined, he
shook hands with them, and speaking to two of them by name, he said,
&#8220;Good bye, God bless you.&#8221; They appeared considerably affected by the
wretched appearance which he made, and &#8220;God bless you!&#8221; &#8220;May God
receive your soul!&#8221; were frequently uttered as he passed along. The
chaplain walked before the prisoner, reading the usual Burial Service,
and the Governor and Officers walking immediately after him. The
prisoner was supported to the steps which led to the scaffold; he
looked somewhat wildly around, and a constable was obliged to support
him while the hangman was adjusting the fatal cord. There was a
barrier to keep off the crowd, amounting to upwards of 7,000 persons,
who at the time had stationed themselves in the adjoining fields, on
the hedges, the tops of houses, and at every point from which a view
of the execution could be best obtained. The prisoner, a few moments
before the drop fell, groaned heavily, and would have fallen, had not
a second constable caught hold of him. Everything having been made
ready, the signal was given, the fatal drop fell, and the unfortunate
man was launched into eternity. Just before he was turned off, he said
in a feeble tone, &#8220;I am justly sentenced, and may God forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img123b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>On the 22nd of April, James Greenacre was found guilty of the wilful
murder of Hannah Brown, and Sarah Gale with being accessary after the
fact. A long and connected chain of evidence was produced, which
showed, that the sack in which the body was found was the property of
Mr. Ward; that is was usually deposited in a part of the premises
which led to the workshop, and could without observation have been
carried away by him; that the said sack contained several fragments of
shavings of mahogany, such as were made in the course of business by
Ward; and that it contained some pieces of linen cloth, which had been
patched with nankeen; that this linen cloth matched exactly with a
frock which was found on Greenacre&#8217;s premises, and which belonged to
the female prisoner. Feltham, a police-officer, deposed, that on the
26th of March he apprehended the prisoners at the lodgings of
Greenacre; that on searching the trowsers pockets of that person, he
took therefrom a pawnbroker&#8217;s duplicate for two silk gowns, and from
the fingers of the female prisoner two rings, and also a similar
duplicate for two veils, and an old-fashioned silver watch, which she
was endeavouring to conceal; and it was further proved that these
articles were pledged by the prisoners, and that they had been the
property of the deceased woman.&mdash;Two surgeons were examined, whose
evidence was most important, and whose depositions were of the
greatest consequence in throwing a clear light on the manner in which
the female, Hannah Brown, met with her death. Mr. Birtwhistle deposed,
that he had carefully examined the head; that the right eye had been
knocked out by a blow inflicted while the person was living; there was
also a cut on the cheek, and the jaw was fractured, these two last
wounds were, in his opinion, produced after death; there was also a
bruise on the head, which had occurred after death; the head had been
separated by cutting, and the bone sawed nearly <i>through</i>, and then
broken off; there were the marks of a saw, which fitted with a saw
which was found in Greenacre&#8217;s box. Mr. Girdwood, a surgeon, very
minutely and skilfully described the appearances presented on the
head, and showed incontestibly, that the head had been severed from
the body <i>while the person was yet alive</i>; that this was proved by the
retraction, or drawing back, of the muscles at the parts where they
were separated by the knife, and further, by the blood-vessels being
empty, the body was drained of blood. This part of the evidence
produced a thrill of horror throughout the court, but Greenacre
remained quite unmoved.</p>

<p>After a most impressive and impartial summing up by the learned Judge,
the jury retired, and, after the absence of a quarter of an hour,
returned into court, and pronounced a verdict of &#8220;Guilty&#8221; against both
the prisoners.</p>

<p>The prisoners heard the verdict without evincing the least emotion, or
the slightest change of countenance. After an awful silence of a few
minutes, the Lord Chief Justice said they might retire, as they would
be remanded until the end of the session.</p>

<p>They were then conducted from the bar, and on going down the steps,
the unfortunate female prisoner kissed Greenacre with every mark of
tenderness and affection.</p>

<p>The crowd outside the court on this day was even greater than on
either of the preceding; and when the result of the trial was made
known in the street, a sudden and general shout succeeded, and
continued huzzas were heard for several minutes.</p>


<p class="center"><br />THE EXECUTION.</p>

<p>At half past seven the sheriff arrived in his carriage, and in a short
time the press-yard was thronged with gentlemen who had been admitted
by tickets. The unhappy convict was now led from his cell. When he
arrived in the press-yard, his whole appearance pourtrayed the utmost
misery and spirit-broken dejection; his countenance haggard, and his
whole frame agitated; all that self-possession and fortitude which he
displayed in the early part of his imprisonment, had utterly forsaken
him, and had left him a victim of hopelessness and despair. He
requested the executioner to give him as little pain as possible in
the process of pinioning his arms and wrists; he uttered not a word in
allusion to his crime; neither did he make any dying request, except
that his spectacles might be given to Sarah Gale; he exhibited no sign
of hope; he showed no symptom of reconciliation with his offended God!
When the venerable ordinary preceded him in the solemn procession
through the vaulted passage to the fatal drop, he was so overcome and
unmanned, that he could not support himself without the aid of the
assistant executioner. At the moment he ascended the faithless floor,
from which he was to be launched into eternity, the most terrific
yells, groans, and cheers were vociferated by the immense multitude
surrounding the place of execution. Greenacre bowed to the sheriff,
and begged he might not be allowed to remain long in the concourse;
and almost immediately the fatal bolt was withdrawn, and, without a
struggle, he became a lifeless corse.&mdash;Thus ended the days of
Greenacre, a man endowed with more than ordinary talents, respectably
connected, and desirably placed in society; but a want of probity, an
absolute dearth of principle, led him on from one crime to another,
until at length he perpetrated the sanguinary deed which brought his
career to an awful and disgraceful period, and which has enrolled his
name among the most notorious of those who have expiated their crime
on the gallows.</p>

<p>On hearing the death-bell toll, Gale became dreadfully agitated; and
when she heard the brutal shouts of the crowd of spectators, she
fainted, and remained in a state of alternate mental agony and
insensibility throughout the whole day.</p>

<p>After having been suspended the usual time, his body was cut down, and
buried in a hole dug in one of the passages of the prison, near the
spot where Thistlewood and his associates were deposited.</p>

<p class="center"><br />THE VERDICT.</p>

<p class="right">Old Bailey, Saturday Evening,<br />
<span style="padding-right: 2em;"><i>June 20th, 1840</i>.</span></p>

<p>After the jury had been absent for an hour and twenty minutes, they
returned into court, and the prisoner was again placed at the bar.</p>

<p>The names of the jury were then called over, and the clerk of the
court said&mdash;&#8220;How say you, gentlemen, have you agreed on your verdict?
Do you find the prisoner Guilty or Not Guilty of the felony of murder
with which he stands charged?&#8221;</p>

<p>The foreman of the jury, in a low voice, said&mdash;&#8220;We find him GUILTY!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Clerk of the Court then said: Fran&ccedil;ois Benjamin Courvoisier, you
have been found Guilty of the wilful murder of William Russell, Esq.,
commonly called Lord William Russell; what have you to say why the
court should not give you sentence to die according to law?</p>

<p>The prisoner made no reply. The usual proclamation for silence was
then made.</p>


<p class="center"><br />SENTENCE.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lord Chief Justice Tindal</span>, having put on the black cap, said:
Fran&ccedil;ois Benjamin Courvoisier, you have been found guilty by an
intelligent, patient, and impartial jury of the crime of wilful
murder. That crime has been established against you, not indeed by the
testimony of eye-witnesses as to the fact, but by a chain of
circumstances no less unerring, which have left no doubt of your guilt
in the minds of the jury, and all those who heard the trial. It is
ordained by divine authority that the murderer shall not escape
justice, and this ordination has been exemplified in your case, in the
course of this trial, by the disclosure of evidence which has brought
the facts to bear against you in a conclusive manner. The murder,
although committed in the dark and silent hour of night, has
nevertheless been brought clearly to light by Divine interposition.
The precise motive which induced you to commit this guilty act can
only be known to your own conscience; but it now only remains for me
to recommend you most earnestly to employ the short time you have to
live in prayer and repentance, and in endeavouring to make your peace
with that Almighty Being whose law you have broken, and before whom
you must shortly appear. The Learned Judge then passed sentence on the
prisoner in the usual form.</p>

<p>The court was very much crowded to the last.</p>


<p class="center"><br />THE CONFESSION OF THE CONVICT.</p>

<p>After the Learned Judge had passed sentence on the convict, he was
removed from the bar, and immediately made a full confession of his guilt.</p>


<p class="center"><br />THE EXECUTION.</p>

<p>At eight o&#8217;clock this morning, Courvoisier ascended the steps leading
to the gallows, and advanced, without looking round him, to the centre
of the platform, followed by the executioner and the ordinary of the
prison, the Rev. Mr Carver. On his appearance a few yells of
execration escaped from a portion of the crowd, but the general body
of the people, great as must have been their abhorrence of his
atrocious crime, remained silent spectators of the scene which was
passing before their eyes. The prisoner&#8217;s manner was marked by an
extraordinary appearance of firmness. His step was steady and
collected, and his movements free from the slightest agitation or
indecision. His countenance indeed was pale, and bore the trace of
much dejection, but it was at the same time calm and unmoved. While
the executioner was placing him on the drop he slightly moved his
hands (which were tied in front of him, and strongly clasped one
within the other) up and down two or three times, and this was the
only visible symptom of any emotion or mental anguish which the
wretched man endured. His face was then covered with the cap, fitting
so closely as not to conceal the outlines of his countenance, the
noose was then adjusted. During this operation he lifted up his head
and raised his hands to his breast, as if in the action of fervent
prayer. In a moment the fatal bolt was withdrawn, the drop fell, and
in this attitude the murderer perished. He died without any violent
struggle. In two minutes after he had fallen his legs were twice
slightly convulsed, but no further motion was observable, excepting
that his raised arms, gradually losing their vitality, sank down from
their own lifeless weight.</p>

<p>After hanging one hour, the body was cut down and removed within the
prison.</p>

<p><br /><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>&#8220;Songs! Songs! Songs! Beautiful songs! Love songs; Newest songs! Old
songs! Popular songs! Songs, <i>Three Yards a Penny!</i>&#8221; was a &#8220;standing dish&#8221;
at the &#8220;Catnach Press,&#8221; and Catnach was the Leo X. of street publishers.
And it is said that he at one time kept a fiddler on the premises, and
that he used to sit receiving ballad writers and singers, and judging of
the merits of any production which was brought to him, by having it sung
then and there to some popular air played by his own fiddler, and so that
the ballad-singer should be enabled to start at once, not only with the
new song, but also the tune to which it was adapted. His broad-sheets
contain all sorts of songs and ballads, for he had a most catholic taste,
and introduced the custom of taking from any writer, living or dead,
whatever he fancied, and printing it side by side with the productions of
his own clients.</p>

<p>Catnach, towards the latter part of his time and in his threefold capacity
of publisher, compositor, and poet, was in the habit of taking things very
easy, and always appeared to the best advantage when in his printing
office, or stationed behind the ricketty counter which for a number of
years had done good service in the shop in Monmouth-court. In this
uncongenial atmosphere, where the rays of the sun are seldom or never
seen, Jemmy was as happy as a prince. &#8220;A poor man&#8217;s home is his castle,&#8221;
so says an old proverb, and no one could have been prouder than he was
when despatching to almost every town in the kingdom some specialty in the
printing department. He naturally had a bit of a taste for old ballads,
music, and song writing; and in this respect he was far in advance of many
of his contemporaries. To bring within the reach of all, the standard and
popular works of the day, had been the ambition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> of the elder Catnach;
whilst the son was, <i>nolens volens</i>, incessant in his endeavours in trying
to promulgate and advance, not the beauty, elegance, and harmony which
pervades many of our national airs and ballad poety, but very often the
worst and vilest of each and every description&mdash;in other words, those most
suitable for street sale. His stock of songs was very like his customers,
diversified. There were all kinds, to suit all classes. Love, sentimental,
and comic songs were so interwoven as to form a trio of no ordinary amount
of novelty. At ordinary times, when the Awfuls and Sensationals were flat,
Jemmy did a large stroke of business in this line.</p>

<p>It is said that when the &#8220;Songs&mdash;<i>Three-yards-a-penny</i>&#8221;&mdash;first came out
and had all the attractions of novelty, some men sold twelve or fourteen
dozen on fine days during three or four of the summer months, so clearing
between 6s. and 7s. a day, but on the average about 25s. per week profit.
The &#8220;long songs,&#8221; however, have been quite superseded by the &#8220;Monster&#8221; and
&#8220;Giant Penny Song Books.&#8221; Still there are a vast number of halfpenny
ballad-sheets worked off, and in proportion to their size, far more than
the &#8220;Monsters&#8221; or &#8220;Giants.&#8221; One song book, entitled the &#8220;Little Warbler,&#8221;
was published in parts, and had an enormous sale.</p>

<p>There are invariably but two songs printed on the half-penny
ballad-sheets&mdash;generally a new and popular song with another older ditty,
or a comic and sentimental, and &#8220;adorned&#8221; with two woodcuts. These are
selected without any regard to their fitness to the subject, and in most
cases have not the slightest reference to the ballad of which they form
the headpiece. For instance:&mdash;&#8220;The Heart that can feel for another&#8221; is
illustrated by a gaunt and savage-looking lion; &#8220;When I was first
Breeched,&#8221; by an engraving of a Highlander <i>sans culotte</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> &#8220;The Poacher&#8221;
comes under the cut of a youth with a large watering-pot, tending flowers;
&#8220;Ben Block&#8221; is heralded by the rising sun; &#8220;The London Oyster Girl,&#8221; by
Sir Walter Raleigh; &#8220;The Sailors Grave,&#8221; by the figure of Justice; &#8220;Alice

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Long-song Seller.</span></p>

<p>Besides the chanters, who sing the songs through the streets of every
city, town, village, and hamlet in the kingdom&mdash;the long-song seller, who
shouts their titles on the kerb-stone, and the countless small
shop-keepers, who, in swag-shops, toy-shops, sweetstuff-shops,
tobacco-shops, and general shops, keep them as part of their stock for the
supply of the street boys and the servant girls&mdash;there is another
important functionary engaged in their distribution, and who is well known
to the inhabitants of large towns, this is the pinner-up, who takes his
stand against a dead wall or a long range of iron railings, and first
festooning it liberally with twine, pins up one or two hundred ballads for
public perusal and selection. Time was when this was a thriving trade: and
we are old enough to remember the day when a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> half-mile of wall
fluttered with the minstrelsy of war and love, under the guardianship of a
scattered file of pinners-up, along the south side of Oxford-street alone.
Thirty years ago the dead walls gave place to shop fronts, and the
pinners-up departed to their long homes. As they died out very few
succeeded to their honours and emoluments. There is one pinner-up,
seemingly the last of his race, who makes his display on the dead wall of
the underground railway in Farringdon road.</p>

<p>Catnach, to the day of his retirement from business in 1838, when he
purchased the freehold of a disused public-house, which had been known as
the Lion Inn, together with the grounds attached at Dancer&#8217;s-hill, South
Mimms, near Barnet, in the county of Middlesex, worked and toiled in the
office of the &#8220;Seven Dials Press,&#8221; in which he had moved as the pivot, or
directing mind, for upwards of a quarter of a century. He lived and died a
bachelor. His only idea of all earthly happiness and mental enjoyment was
now to get away in retirement to a convenient distance from his old place
of business, so to give him an opportunity occasionally to go up to town
and have a chat and a friendly glass with one or two old paper-workers and
ballad-writers, and a few others connected with his peculiar trade who had
shown any disposition to work when work was to be done. To them he was
always willing to give or advance a few pence or shillings, in money or
stock, and a glass.</p>

<p>Catnach left the whole of the business to Mrs. Anne Ryle, his sister,
charged, nevertheless, to the amount of &pound;1,000, payable at his death to
the estate of his niece, Marion Martha Ryle. In the meanwhile Mr. James
Paul acted as managing man for Mrs. Ryle. This Mr. Paul&mdash;of whom Jemmy was
very fond, and rumour saith, had no great dislike to the mother&mdash;had
grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> from a boy to a man in the office of the &#8220;Catnach Press.&#8221; He was,
therefore, well acquainted with the customers, by whom he was much
respected; and it was by his tact and judgment that the business was kept
so well together. At Catnach&#8217;s death he entered into partnership with Mrs.
Ryle, and the business was carried on under the title and style of Paul &amp;
Co. In 1845 the partnership was dissolved, Mr. Paul receiving &pound;800 in
settlement. He then entered into the public line, taking the Spencer&#8217;s
Arms, at the corner of Monmouth-court. A son that was born to him in 1847,
he had christened James Catnach Paul. About this date &#8220;The Catnach Press&#8221;
had a formidable rival in &#8220;The Nassau Steam Press,&#8221; which was originally
started in Nassau Street, Soho, and afterwards removed to No. 60, St.
Martin&#8217;s Lane. Mr. Paul was especially engaged to manage the song
department at this office. He died in the year 1870, just six weeks after
Mrs. Ryle, and lies buried in the next grave but one to Catnach and his
sister, in Highgate Cemetery.</p>

<p>After Mr. Paul had left the business it was carried on as A. Ryle &amp; Co.,
and ultimately became the property of Mr. W. S. Fortey, who still carries
on the old business in the same premises. A copy of whose trade
announcement runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<i>Late Mayor of Garratt, and Itinerant Dealer in Wigs</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>Sir Jeffery Dunstan&mdash;thrice Mayor of Garratt! was the most popular
candidate that ever appeared on the Hustings at that very Free and
Independent Borough! His occupation was that of buying old wigs, once an
article of trade like that of old clothes. Sir Jeffery usually carried his
wig bag over his shoulder, and to avoid the charge of vagrancy,
vociferated, as he passed along the street, &#8220;Old Wigs,&#8221; but having a
person like &AElig;sop, and a countenance and manner marked by irresistible
humour, he never appeared without a train of boys and curious persons,
whom he entertained by his sallies of wit, shrewd sayings, and smart
repartees; and from whom, without begging, he collected sufficient to help
to maintain his dignity of Mayor and Knight.</p>

<p>From the earliest period of Sir Jeffery&#8217;s life, he was a friend to &#8220;good
measures,&#8221; especially those for &#8220;spirituous liquors,&#8221; and he never saw the
inside of a pot without going to the bottom of it. This determination of
character created difficulties to him; for his freedom was not always
regulated by the doctrines of <i>meum et tuum</i>, or, of the great Blackstone,
&#8220;on the rights of persons,&#8221; and consequences ensued that were occasionally
injurious to Sir Jeffery&#8217;s eyes, face, and nose. The same enlightened
Judge&#8217;s views of &#8220;the rights of property,&#8221; were not comprehended by Sir
Jeffery, he had long made free with the porter of manifold pots, and at
length he made free with a few of the pots&mdash;which the publicans in London
seemed to show in the streets as much as to say &#8220;Come and steal me.&#8221; For
this he was &#8220;questioned&#8221; in the high Commission Court of oyer and
terminer, and suffered an imprisonment, which, according to his manner of
life, and his notions of the liberty of the subject, was &#8220;frivolous and
vexatious.&#8221; On his liberation, he returned to an occupation he had long
followed, the dealing in &#8220;Old Wigs.&#8221; Some other circumstances, developed
in course of the preceding inquiry, seem to favour a supposition that the
bag he carried had enabled him to conceal his previous &#8220;free trade&#8221; in
pewter pots. But, be that as it might, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> certain that in his armorial
bearings of four wigs, he added a quart pot for a crest.</p>

<p>Sir Jeffery was remarkably dirty in his person, and always had his shirt
thrown open, which exposed his breast to public view. This was in him a
sort of pride; for he would frequently in an exulting manner say to
<i>inferiors</i> &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a <i>collar</i> to my shirt, sir.&#8221; He had a filthy habit,
when he saw a number of girls around him, of spitting in their faces,
saying, &#8220;There, go about your business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Jeffery, in the days of his prosperity, took his &#8220;Hodges&#8217; best,&#8221; at
the &#8220;Blind Beggar of Bethnal-green,&#8221; or the &#8220;Horse and Leaping Bar,&#8221;
High-street, Whitechapel, at one or other of these favourite retreats, he
got in a regular manner &#8220;regularly drunk.&#8221; Then it was that he sung in his
best style various popular &#8220;London Cries,&#8221; mimicking others in their
crying, especially one who vended &#8220;<i>Lily, lily, lily, lily white&mdash;sand oh!
oh!! oh!!!</i>&#8221; this afforded sport to a merry company. Afterwards, should
Sir Jeffery receive sufficient metalic support from his friends, he was
placed in an arm chair on the table, when he recited to the students of
the London Hospital and the Bucks of the East, his mock-election speeches.
He was no respecter of persons, and was so severe in his jokes on the
corruptions and compromises of power, that he was prosecuted for using
what were then called seditious expressions. In consequence of this
affair, and some few charges of dishonesty, he lost his popularity, and,
at the next general election was ousted by Sir Harry Dimsdale,
muffin-seller, a man as much deformed as himself. Sir Jeffery could not
long survive his fall, but, in death as in life, he proved a satire on the
vices of the proud, for he died, like Alexander the Great, the sailor in
Lord Byron&#8217;s &#8220;Don Juan,&#8221; and many other heroes renowned in history&mdash;of
suffocation from excessive drinking!.</p>

sometime Mayor of Garratt, who, from the moment he stood as candidate,
received mock knighthood, and was ever after known under the appellation
of &#8220;Sir Harry.&#8221; This half-witted character was a dealer in

<p>Mr. J. T. Smith, in his ever-charming work of &#8220;A Book for a Rainy Day; or,
Recollections of the Events of the Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> 1766-1833,&#8221; writing under date
1787, gives the following graphic sketch of the sayings and doings&mdash;taken
from life, of &#8220;Sir Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the curious scenes I witnessed on a nocturnal visit to the watch
house of St. Anne, Soho, afforded me no small amusement. Sir Harry
Dinsdale, usually called Dimsdale, a short, feeble little man, was brought
in, charged by two colossal guardians of the night with conduct most
unruly. &#8216;What have you, Sir Harry, to say to all this?&#8217; asked the Dogberry
of St. Anne. The knight, who had been roughly handled, commenced like a
true orator, in a low tone of voice. &#8216;May it please ye, my magistrate, I
am not drunk; it is <i>languor</i>. A parcel of the Bloods of the Garden have
treated me cruelly, because I would not treat them. This day, sir, I was
sent for by Mr. Sheridan, to make a speech upon the table at the
Shakespeare Tavern, in <i>Common</i> Garden; he wrote the speech for me, and
always gives half a guinea; he sends for me to the tavern. You see I
didn&#8217;t go in my Royal robes, I only put &#8217;um on when I stand to be a
member.&#8217; The constable&mdash;&#8216;Well, but Sir Harry, why are you brought here?&#8217;
One of the watchmen then observed, &#8216;That though Sir Harry was but a little
<i>shambling</i> fellow, he was so <i>upstroppolus</i>, and kicked him about at such
a rate, that it was as much as he and his comrade could do to bring him
along.&#8217; As there was no one to support the charge, Sir Harry was advised
to go home, which, however, he swore he would not do at midnight without
an escort. &#8216;Do you know,&#8217; said he, &#8216;there&#8217;s a parcel of <i>raps</i> now on the
outside waiting for me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The constable of the night gave orders for him to be protected to the
public-house opposite the west end of St. Giles&#8217;s Church, where he then
lodged. Sir Harry, hearing a noise in the street, muttered, &#8216;I shall catch
it; I know I shall.&#8217; (<i>Cries without</i>,) &#8216;See the conquering hero comes.&#8217;
&#8216;Ay, they always use that tune when I gain my election at Garratt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several portraits of this singular little object, by some
called &#8216;Honey-juice.&#8217; Flaxman, the sculptor, and Mrs. Mathews, of
blue-stocking memory, equipped him as a hardware man, and as such I made
two etchings of him.&#8221;</p>

<span class="smcap">Smith&#8217;s</span> well-known red <span class="smcap">Express-carts</span> laden with the early printed
newspapers of the coming day, while all night long the carts and waggons
come rumbling in from the country to Covent-garden, and not the least
pleasant sound&mdash;pleasant for its old recollections&mdash;is the time-honoured
old cry of &#8220;Hot Cross-Buns.&#8221; Century after century passes by, and those
who busily drove their carts day after day from Isleworth, Romford,
Enfield, Battersea, Blackheath, or Richmond, one hundred years ago, are as
still and silent as if they had never been; yet still, Passion week after
Passion week, comes that old cry, nobody knows how old, &#8220;Hot Cross Buns,
Hot Cross Buns.&#8221; And as we lie in a half dreamy state we hear and think of
the chimes of St. Clement Danes, which may still be heard, as Fallstaff
describes, having heard them with Justice Shallow; also, how Pope, as he
lay in Holywell-street&mdash;now Bookseller&#8217;s-row; and Addison and Johnson;
and, before their time, Waller, at the house of his old friend the
merchant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> of St. Giles&#8217;s; and the goodly company of poets that lived at
the cost of the king, near Whitehall; then of the quaint old gossiping
diarist, Samuel Pepys, Secretary of the Admiralty; John Taylor, the
<i>Water-Poet</i>; even Shakespeare himself, having each in their turn been
awakened on the Good Friday morning by the same sound ringing in their
ears. For this is a custom which can hardly be traced to a beginning: and
all we know about it is, that as far as we can go back, the Good Friday
was ushered in by the old Good Friday bun; and that the baker in the
towns, and the old good wife in the country, would have thought the day
but badly kept, and augured badly for the coming summer&#8217;s luck, without
it.</p>

<p>But between the cakes of Cecrops and the modern Hot Cross Bun there is a
wide gulf of 3,400 years; and yet the one may be traced up to the other.
There are some, indeed, who would wish to give to the Good Friday Hot
Cross Bun a still longer pedigree, and to take it back to the time of the
Patriarchs and their consecrated bread; and there are others who would go
yet further, and trace it to the earliest age of the world, in a portion
of Cain&#8217;s sacrifice. We may, however, content ourselves with stopping
short at the era of the Egyptian Cecrops, founder of Athens, who made his
sweet cakes of flour and honey. Such cakes as these, as we learn from the
prophet Jeremiah, were offered by the idolatrous Hebrew women to &#8220;the
Queen of Heaven,&#8221;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;Ashtoreth, whom the Ph&oelig;nicians called<br />
Astarte, Queen of Heaven, with cresent horns.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>Some can even discern Astarte in our &#8220;Easter.&#8221; The Jews of old had the
shew-bread and the wafer of unleavened bread; and the Egyptians, under the
Pharaohs, had also their cakes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> round, oval, and triangular. The Persians
had their sacred cakes of flour and honey; and Herodotus speaks of similar
cakes being offered by the Athenians to a sacred serpent in the temple of
their citadel. And, not to mention other nations, the circumstance that
accompanied the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny, 1857, will make memorable
the &#8220;chupatties&#8221; or sacred cakes of Khrishna.</p>

<p>The cakes that were offered to Luna by the Greeks and Romans were either
crescent-shaped, or were marked with the crescent moon; and this stamp
must have been very similar to that impressed on the cakes offered by the
Hebrew women to the Queen of Heaven. This mark also resembles that
representing the horns of the sacred ox which was stamped on the Grecian
cakes; and the ox was <i>bous</i>, and, in one of its oblique cases, <i>boun</i>, so
we derive from that word <i>boun</i> our familiar &#8220;bun.&#8221; There were not only
horn-marked cakes, but horn-marked pieces of money; so that it is very
difficult to ascertain the true meaning of that passage in the opening of
the &#8220;Agamemnon&#8221; of &AElig;schylus, where the watchman says that a great <i>bous</i>
has come, or set foot, upon his tongue. Although it might mean that
something as weighty as an ox&#8217;s hoof had weighed down his tongue, yet it
more probably signifies either that he was bribed to silence with a piece
of money marked with the ox&#8217;s horns, or that the partaking of a sacred
horn-marked cake had initiated him into a certain secret. Curiously
enough, in the <i>argot</i> of thieves, at the present day, a crown piece is
termed &#8220;a bull;&#8221; and it may also be noted that <i>pecunia</i>, &#8220;money,&#8221; is
derived from <i>pecus</i>, &#8220;cattle;&#8221; and &#8220;bull&#8221; is derived from <i>bous</i>, and
also &#8220;cow&#8221; from the same word, through the Sanscrit <i>gou</i>, the <i>b</i> and <i>g</i>
being convertible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>Thus, originally, the <i>boun</i> or bun was the cake marked with the horns of
the sacred ox. The cross mark was first adopted by the Greeks and Romans
to facilitate the division of the cake into four equal parts; and two such
cross-marked cakes were found in the ruins of Herculaneum. These cakes
were adopted by the early Christians in a spirit of symbolism; but,
although the cross was marked on the cake in token of the badge of their
faith, yet it was also used by the priest for the breaking of the cake, or
Eucharistic wafer, into four pieces; and this was so ordered in the
Liturgy of St. Chrysostom. The cross-marked buns are now, for popular use,
reserved for Good Friday, and, as Lenten cakes, are peculiar to this
country. Among the Syrian Christians of Travancore and Cochin, who trace
their descent from those who were converted by St. Thomas on his
(supposed) visit to India, a peculiar cake is made for &#8220;Sorrowful
Friday&#8221;&mdash;as they term Good Friday. The cake is stuffed with sweetmeats in
the form of an eye, to represent the evil eye of Judas, coveting the
thirty pieces of silver; and the cake is flung at with sticks by the
members of the family until the eye is quite put out; they then share the
remains of the cake among them.</p>

<p>In the days before the Reformation, <i>eulogi&aelig;</i>, or cross-marked consecrated
cakes, were made from the dough of the mass-bread, and distributed by the
priests to be eaten at home by those who had been prevented by sickness or
infirmity from attending the mass. After the Reformation, Protestants
would readily retain the custom of eating in their houses a cross marked
cake, although no longer connecting it with a sacred rite, but restricting
its use to that one day of the year known as &#8220;Holy Friday,&#8221; or &#8220;Long
Friday&#8221;&mdash;from the length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> of the service on that day&mdash;but which gradually
came to be called, by the Anglican Church, &#8220;Good Friday,&#8221; in remembrance
of the good things secured to mankind on that day. The presence upon the
breakfast-table of the cross marked bun, flavoured with allspice, in token
of the spices that were prepared by the pious women of Galilee, was,
therefore, regarded in the light of a remembrancer of the solemnities of
the day. The buns were made on the previous evening, Maundy Thursday so
called, either from the &#8220;maunds,&#8221; or baskets, in which Easter gifts were
distributed, or, more probably, because it was the <i>Dies mandati</i>, the day
of the command, &#8220;That thou doest, do quickly!&#8221; as also, &#8220;Do this in
remembrance of Me!&#8221; and that the disciples should love one another and
should show humility in the washing of feet.</p>

<p>As Chelsea was long famous for its buns&mdash;which are mentioned by Swift to
Stella, in 1712&mdash;it was not to be wondered at that it should be celebrated
for its production of hot cross buns on Good Friday. Early in the present
century there were two bun-houses at Chelsea, both claiming to be &#8220;Royal&#8221;
as well as &#8220;Original,&#8221; until, at last, one of the two proclaimed itself to
be &#8220;The Real Old Original Bun House.&#8221; These two houses did a roaring trade
during the whole of Good Friday, their piazzas being crowded, from six in
the morning to six in the evening, by crowds of purchasers, loungers, and
gossipers. Good King George the Third would come there with his children;
and, of course, the nobility and gentry followed his example. These two
bun-houses were swallowed up, in the march of improvement, some forty
years ago; but on Good Friday, 1830, 240,000 hot cross buns were sold
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>The cross bun is not without its folk-lore. Country folks attach much
virtue to the Good Friday buns; and many are kept for &#8220;luck&#8217;s sake&#8221; in
cottages from one Good Friday to another. They are not only considered to
be preservatives from sickness and disease, but also as safeguards from
fire and lightning. They are supposed never to get mouldy, as was noted by
&#8220;Poor Robin,&#8221; in his Almanack for 1733, under the head of March:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>&#8220;Good Friday comes this month: the old woman runs<br />
With one a penny, two a penny hot cross-buns;<br />
Whose virtue is, if you&#8217;ll believe what&#8217;s said,<br />
They&#8217;ll not grow mouldy like the common bread.&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>Furthermore, be it known, then, in the interests of suffering humanity,
that if a piece of a Good Friday bun is grated and eaten, it will cure as
many diseases as were ever cured by a patent pill; moreover, the animal
world is not shut out from sharing in its benefits, for it will cure a
calf from &#8220;scouring,&#8221; and mixed in a warm mash, it is the very best remedy
for your cow. Thus the bun is good for the <i>boun</i>; in fact, it is good
both for man and beast.</p>

<p>The sellers of the Good Friday buns are composed of old men and young men,
old women and young women, big children and little children, but
principally boys, and they are of mixed classes, as, costers&#8217; boys, boys
habitually and boys occasionally street-sellers, and boys&mdash;&#8220;some cry now
who never cried before,&#8221; and for that occasion only. One great inducement
to embark in the trade is the hope of raising a little money for the
Easter holidays following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>The &#8220;cry&#8221; of the Hot Cross Bun vendor varies at times and in places&mdash;as

One-a-penny, two for <i>tup&#8217;ence</i>, hot cross buns!&#8221;</td></tr></table>

<p>While some of a humorous turn of mind like to introduce a little bit of
their own, or the borrowed wit of those who have gone before them, and
effect the <i>one</i> step which is said to exist from the sublime to the
ridiculous, and cry&mdash;</p>

<p>But the street hot-cross-bun trade is languishing&mdash;and languishing, will
ultimately die a natural death, as the master bakers and pastrycooks have

<p>A capital writer of <span class="smcap">Notes</span>, <span class="smcap">Comment</span> and <span class="smcap">Gossip</span>, who contributes every week
to the <i>City Press</i>, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of &#8220;Dogberry,&#8221; gave&mdash;<i>inter
alia</i>&mdash;a few &#8220;<i>Good Words</i>,&#8221; the result of his &#8220;<i>Leisure Hours</i>&#8221; in that
journal, on the subject of &#8220;Good Friday Customs.&#8221; March 24, 1883, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;That the buns themselves are as popular as ever they were when the
Real Original Bun Houses existed in Chelsea, was manifest on Thursday
evening, though the scene is now changed from the west to the east.
Bishopsgate-street was indeed all alive with people of high and low
degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span> crowding in and out of Messrs. Hill &amp; Sons, who, I am told,
turned no less than 47 sacks of flour, representing over 13,000 lbs.,
into the favourite Good Friday cakes. This mass was sweetened by 2,800
lbs. of sugar, moistened with 1,500 quarts of milk, and &#8216;lightened&#8217;
with 2,200 lbs. of butter. Something like 25,000 paper bags were used
in packing the buns, and upwards of 150 pairs of hands were engaged in
the making and distribution of the tasty morsels at Bishopsgate and at
the West-end branch of Messrs. Hill, at Victoria. The customary
business of the firm must have been interrupted considerably by Good
Friday, and the forty-seven sacks of flour made into buns represented,
I presume, a considerable deduction from the hundred and ninety to two
hundred which the firm work up in one form or another every week. But
then you can&#8217;t eat your (Good Friday) cake and have it. There were
other bakers and confectioners in the City, too, who appeared to do a
thriving trade in buns&mdash;notably Messrs. Robertson &amp; Co., in
Aldersgate-street. Long live the Good Friday bun!&#8221;</p>

<p>The street Pieman with his &#8220;cry,&#8221; of &#8220;Pies all hot! hot!! hot!!!&mdash;Penny
pies, all hot! hot!!&mdash;fruit, eel, beef, veal or kidney pies! pies, all
hot-hot-hot,&#8221; is one of the most ancient of street callings, and to London
boys of every degree, &#8220;Familiar in their mouths as household words.&#8221; Nor
is the itinerant trade in pies&mdash;&#8220;Eel, beef, veal, kidney or fruit,&#8221;
confined to the great metropolis. All large provincial towns have, from a
time going back much farther than even the proverbial &#8220;oldest inhabitant&#8221;
can recollect, had their old and favourite &#8220;Penny Pieman,&#8221; or,
&#8220;<i>Old-all-Hot!</i>&#8221; as folks were ever wont to call him. He was generally a
merry dog, and mostly to be found where merriment was going on, he
scrupled not to force his way through the thickest of the crowd, knowing
that the very centre of action was the best market for his wares.</p>

<p>James Lackington&mdash;1746-1816&mdash;one of the most celebrated of our early cheap
booksellers, lived at the &#8220;Temple of Muses,&#8221; Finsbury-place&mdash;the shop,
into which a coach and six could be driven. This curious mixture of
cobbler&#8217;s wax, piety, vanity, and love of business, has left us in his
autobiography, which he published under the title of his &#8220;<i>Memoirs and
Confessions</i>,&#8221; his experience as a pie-boy! or seller of pies, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;At ten years old I cried apple pies in the street. I had noticed a
famous pieman, and thought I could do it better myself. My mode of
crying pies soon made me a street favourite, and the old pie merchant
left off trade. You see, friend, I soon began to make a noise in the
world. But one day I threw my master&#8217;s child out of a wheelbarrow, so
I went home again, and was set by my father to learn his trade,
continuing with him for several years. My fame as a pieman led to my
selling almanacks on the market days at Christmas. This was to my
mind, and I sorely vexed the [regular] vendors of &#8216;Moore,&#8217; &#8216;Wing,&#8217; and
&#8216;Poor Robin.&#8217; My next move was to be bound apprentice for seven
years.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>We frequently meet with the pieman in old prints; and in Hogarth&#8217;s &#8220;March
to Finchley,&#8221; there he stands in the very centre of the crowd, grinning
with delight at the adroitness of one robbery, while he is himself the
victim of another. We learn from this admirable figure by the greatest
painter of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> life, that the pieman of the last century perambulated
the streets in professional costume; and we gather further, from the burly
dimensions of his wares that he kept his trade alive by the laudable
practice of giving &#8220;a good pennyworth for a penny.&#8221; Justice compels us to
observe that his successors of a later generation have not been very
conscientious observers of this maxim.</p>

<p>At this date there was James Sharpe England, a noted flying pieman, who
attended all the metropolitan festive gatherings; he walked about hatless,
to sell his savoury wares, with his hair powdered and tied <i>en queue</i>, his
dress neat, apron spotless, jesting wherever he went, with a mighty voice
in recommendation of the puddings and pies, which, for the sake of greater
oddity he sometimes carried on a wooden platter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>The London pieman, as he takes his walks abroad, makes a practice of
&#8220;looking in&#8221; at all the taverns on his way. Here his customers are found
principally in the tap-room. &#8220;Here they are, all &#8217;ot!&#8221; the pieman cries,
as he walks in; &#8220;toss or buy! up and win &#8217;em!&#8221; For be it known to all whom
it may concern, the pieman is a gambler, both from inclination and
principle, and will toss with his customers, either by the dallying
shilly-shally process of &#8220;best five in nine,&#8221; or &#8220;best two in three,&#8221; or
the desperate dash of &#8220;sudden death!&#8221; in which latter case the first toss
decides the matter, <i>viz</i>:&mdash;a pie for a penny, or your penny gone for
nothing, but he invariably declines the mysterious process of &#8220;odd man,&#8221;
not being altogether free from suspicion on the subject of collusion
between a couple of hungry, and not over honestly inclined customers.</p>

<p>Of the &#8220;stuff&#8221; which pie-dealers usually make their wares, much has been
sung and said, and in some neighbourhoods the sight of an approaching
pieman seems to get about an immediate desire for imitating the harmless
cat and its &#8220;Mee-yow,&#8221; or the &#8220;Bow-wow-wow!&#8221; of the dog. And opprobrious
epithets are hurled at the piemen as they parade the streets and alleys,
and even kidnapping has been slyly hinted at, for the mother of Tom
Cladpole, finding her son so determined to make a &#8220;Jurney to
Lunnun&#8221;&mdash;least he should die a fool, tries to frighten the boy out of his
fixed intention by informing him in pure Sussex dialect that:&mdash;</p>

<p>It was ever a safe piece of comic business with Old Joey Grimaldi and his
favourite pupil and successor, Tom Matthews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> together with all other
stage clowns following them, that a penny pieman and the bright shining
block-tin can should be introduced into every Christmas pantomime. The
pataloon is made to be tossing the safe game of&mdash;&#8220;heads I win, tails you
lose&#8221; with the stage pieman, while the roguish clown is adroitly managing
to swallow the whole of the stock of pies from the can, and which are made
by the stage property-man for the occasion out of tissue-paper painted in
water-colours. Then follows the wry faces and spasmodic stomach-pinchings
of the clown, accompanied with the echoing cries of &#8220;<i>Mee, mee, mow,
woo!</i>&#8221; while the pantaloon takes from the pieman&#8217;s can some seven or eight
fine young kittens and the old tabby-cat&mdash;also the handy-work of the stage
property-man. The whole scene usually finishes by the pantaloon pointedly
sympathizing with the now woebegone clown to the tune of &#8220;Serve ye
right&mdash;Greedy! greedy!! greedy!!!&#8221; when enter six supernumeraries dressed
as large and motherly-looking tabbies with aprons and bibs, and bedizened
with white linen night caps of the pattern known in private life to
middle-aged married men only. The clown and pantaloon then work together
in hunting down, and then handing over the poor pieman to the tender
mercies and talons of the stage-cats, who finish up the &#8220;business&#8221; of the
scene by popping the pieman into what looks like a copper of boiling
water.</p>

<p>Mr. Samuel Weller,&mdash;<i>otherwise</i>, Veller, that great modern authority on
Y<sup>e</sup> Manners and Y<sup>e</sup> Customs, of Y<sup>e</sup> English in general, and of London
Life wery Particular:&mdash;for &#8220;Mr. Weller&#8217;s knowldge of London was extensive

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>&#8220;Weal pie,&#8221; said Mr. Weller, soliloquising, as he arranged the
eatables on the grass. &#8220;Werry good thing is a weal pie, when you know
the lady as made it, and is quite sure it an&#8217;t kittens; and arter all,
though, where&#8217;s the odds, when they&#8217;re so like weal that the wery
piemen themselves don&#8217;t know the difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they, Sam?&#8221; said Mr. Pickwick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not they, sir,&#8221; replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat. &#8220;I lodged in
the same house vith a pieman once, sir, and a wery nice man he
was&mdash;reg&#8217;lar clever chap too&mdash;made pies out o&#8217; anything, he could.
&#8216;What a number o&#8217; cats you keep, Mr. Brooks,&#8217; says I, when I&#8217;d got
intimate with him. &#8216;Ah,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I do&mdash;a good many,&#8217; says he. &#8216;You
must be wery fond o&#8217; cats,&#8217; says I. &#8216;Other people is,&#8217; says he, a
winkin&#8217; at me; &#8216;they an&#8217;t in season till the winter though,&#8217; says he.
&#8216;Not in season!&#8217; says I. &#8216;No,&#8217; says he, &#8216;fruits is in, cats is out.&#8217;
&#8216;Why, what do you mean?&#8217; says I. &#8216;Mean?&#8217; says he. &#8216;That I&#8217;ll never be
a party to the combination o&#8217; the butchers, to keep up the prices o&#8217;
meat,&#8217; says he. &#8216;Mr. Weller,&#8217; says he, a squeezing my hand wery hard,
and vispering in my ear&mdash;&#8216;don&#8217;t mention this here agin&mdash;but it&#8217;s the
seasonin&#8217; that does it. They&#8217;re all made o&#8217; them noble animals,&#8217; says
he, a pointin&#8217; to a wery nice little tabby kitten, &#8216;and I seasons &#8217;em
for beef-steaks, weal, or kidney, &#8217;cordin to demand. And more than
that,&#8217; says he, &#8216;I can make a weal a beef-steak, or a beef-steak a
kidney, or any one on &#8217;em a mutton, at a minute&#8217;s notice, just as the
market changes, and appetites wary!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,&#8221; said Mr.
Pickwick, with a slight shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just was, sir,&#8221; replied Mr. Weller, continuing his occupation of
emptying the basket, &#8220;<i>and the pies was beautiful</i>.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;gravy&#8221; given with the meat-pies is poured out of an oil-can and
consists of a little salt and water browned. A hole is made with the
little finger in the top of the pie and the &#8220;gravy&#8221; poured in until the
crust rises sufficiently to satisfy the young critical gourmand&#8217;s taste.</p>

<p>&#8220;The London piemen,&#8221; says Mr. Henry Mayhew, &#8220;May be numbered at about
forty in winter, and twice that number in summer.&#8221; Calculating that there
are only fifty plying their trade the year through, and their average
earnings at 8s. a week, we find a street expenditure exceeding &pound;1,040, and
a street consumption of pies amounting to nearly three quarters of a
million yearly.</p>

<p>The engraving represents an old &#8220;London Crier,&#8221; one William Liston, from a
drawing for which he purposely <i>stood</i> in 1826.</p>

<p>This &#8220;public character&#8221; was born in the City of Glasgow. He became a
soldier in the waggon-train commanded by Colonel Hamilton, and served
under the Duke of York in Holland, where, on the 6th of October, 1799, he
lost his right arm and left leg, and his place in the army. His
misfortunes thrust distinction upon him. From having been a private in the
ranks, where he would have remained undistinguished, he became one of the
popular street-characters of his day.</p>

<p>Billingsgate has from time immemorial had much to do with &#8220;The Cries of
London,&#8221; and although a rough and unromantic place at the present day, has
an ancient legend of its own, that associates it with royal names and
venerable folk. Geoffrey of Monmouth deposeth that about 400 years before
Christ&#8217;s nativity, Belin, a king of the Britons, built this gate and gave
it its name, and that when he was dead the royal body was burnt, and the
ashes set over the gate in a vessel of brass, upon a high pinnacle of
stone. The London historian, John Stow, more prosaic, on the other hand,
is quite satisfied that one Biling once owned the wharf, and troubles
himself no further.</p>

<p>Byllngsgate Dock is mentioned as an important quay in &#8220;Brompton&#8217;s
Chronicle&#8221; (Edward III.), under the date 976, when King Ethelred, being
then at Wantage, in Berkshire, made laws for regulating the customs on
ships at Byllngsgate, then the only wharf in London. 1. Small vessels were
to pay one halfpenny. 2. Larger ones, with sails, one penny. 3. Keeles, or
hulks, still larger, fourpence. 4. Ships laden with wood, one log shall be
given for toll. 5. <i>Boats with fish</i>, according to size, a halfpenny. 6.
Men of Rouen, who came with wine or peas, and men of Flanders and Liege,
were to pay toll before they began to sell, but the Emperor&#8217;s men (Germans
of the Steel Yard) paid an annual toll. 7. Bread was tolled three times a
week, cattle were paid for in kind, and butter and cheese were paid more
for before Christmas than after.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>Hence we gather that at a very early period Billingsgate was not merely a
fish-market, but for the sale of general commodities. Paying toll in kind
is a curious fiscal regulation; though, doubtless, when barter was the
ordinary mode of transacting business, taxes must have been collected in
the form of an instalment of the goods brought to market.</p>

<p>Our ancestors four hundred years ago had, in proportion to the population
of London, much more abundant and much cheaper fish than we have now.
According to the &#8220;Noble Boke off Cookry,&#8221; a reprint of which, from the
rare manuscript in the Holkham Collection, has just been edited by Mrs.
Alexander Napier, Londoners in the reign of Henry VII. could regale on
&#8220;baked porpois,&#8221; &#8220;turbert,&#8221; &#8220;pik in braissille,&#8221; &#8220;mortins of ffishe,&#8221;
&#8220;eles in bruet,&#8221; &#8220;fresh lamprey bak,&#8221; &#8220;breme,&#8221; in &#8220;sauce&#8221; and in &#8220;brasse,&#8221;

for ffishe daies.&#8221; For the rich there were &#8220;potages of oysters,&#8221; &#8220;blang
mang&#8221; and &#8220;rape&#8221; of &#8220;ffishe,&#8221; to say nothing of &#8220;lampry in galantyn&#8221; and
&#8220;lampry bak.&#8221; Our forefathers ate more varieties of fish, cooked it
better, and paid much less for it than we do, with all our railways and
steamboats, our Fisheries&#8217; Inspectors, our Fisheries Exhibion and new Fish
Markets with their liberal rules and regulations. To be sure, those same
forefathers of ours not only enacted certain very stringent laws against
&#8220;forestalling&#8221; and &#8220;regrating,&#8221; but were likewise accustomed to enforce
them, and to make short work upon occasion of the forestalled and
regraters of fish, as of other commodities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>In Donald Lupton&#8217;s &#8220;London and the Covntrey Carbonadoed and Quartred into

of the locality are thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Fisherwomen</span>:&mdash;These crying, wandering, and travelling creatures carry
their shops on their heads, and their storehouse is ordinarily
Byllyngsgate, or Ye Brydge-foot; and their habitation Turnagain Lane.
They set up every morning their trade afresh. They are easily
furnished; get something and spend it jovially and merrily. Five
shillings, a basket, and a good cry, are a large stock for them. They
are the merriest when all their ware is gone. In the morning they
delight to have their shop full; at evening they desire to have it
empty. Their shop is but little, some two yards compass, yet it holds
all sort of fish, or herbs, or roots, and such like ware. Nay, it is
not destitute often of nuts, oranges, and lemons. They are free in all
places, and pay nothing for rent, but only find repairs to it. If they
drink their whole stock, it is but pawning a petticoate in Long Lane,
or themselves in Turnbull Street, to set up again. They change daily;
for she that was for fish this day, may be to-morrow for fruit, next
day for herbs, another for roots; so that you must hear them cry
before you know what they are furnished withal. When they have done
their Fair, they meet in mirth, singing, dancing, and end not till
either their money, or wit, or credit be clean spent out. Well, when
on any evening they are not merry in a drinking house, it is thought
they have had bad return, or else have paid some old score, or else

exactly to the costermonger&#8217;s wives of the present day, who are just as
careless and improvident; they are merry over their rope of onions, and
laugh over a basketful of stale sprats. In their dealings and disputes
they are as noisy as ever, and rather apt to put decency and good manners
to the blush. Billingsgate eloquence has long been proverbial for coarse
language, so that low abuse is often termed, &#8220;<i>That&#8217;s talking
Billingsgate!</i>&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> or, that, &#8220;<i>You are no better than a Billingsgate
fish-fag</i>&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, You are as rude and ill-mannered as the women of
Billingsgate fish-market (Saxon, <i>bellan</i>, &#8220;to bawl,&#8221; and <i>gate</i>, &#8220;quay,&#8221;
meaning the noisy quay). The French say &#8220;Maubert,&#8221; instead of
Billingsgate, as &#8220;<i>Your compliments are like those of the Place
Maubert</i>&#8221;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, No compliments at all, but vulgar dirt-flinging. The
&#8220;Place Maubert,&#8221; has long been noted for its market.</p>

<p>The introduction of steamboats has much altered the aspect of
Billingsgate. Formerly, passengers embarked here for Gravesend and other
places down the river, and a great many sailors mingled with the salesmen
and fishermen. The boats sailed only when the tide served, and the
necessity of being ready at the strangest hours rendered many taverns
necessary for the accommodation of travellers. The market formerly opened
two hours earlier than at present, and the result was demoralising and
exhausting. Drink led to ribald language and fighting, but the refreshment
now taken is chiefly tea or coffee, and the general language and behaviour
has improved. The fish-fags of Ned Ward&#8217;s time have disappeared, and the
business is done smarter and quicker. As late as 1842 coaches would
sometimes arrive at Billingsgate from Dover or Brighton, and so affect the
market. The old circle from which dealers in their carts attended the
market, included Windsor, St. Alban&#8217;s, Hertford, Romford, and other places
within twenty-five miles. Railways have now enlarged the area of
purchasers to an indefinite degree.</p>

<p>To see this market in its busiest time, says Mr. Mayhew, &#8220;the visitor
should be there about seven o&#8217;clock on a Friday morning.&#8221; The market opens
at four, but for the first two or three hours it is attended solely by the
regular fishmongers and &#8220;bummarees,&#8221; who have the pick of the best there.
As soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span> as these are gone the costermonger&#8217;s sale begins. Many of the
costers that usually deal in vegetables buy a little fish on the Friday.
It is the fast day of the Irish, and the mechanics&#8217; wives run short of
money at the end of the week, and so make up their dinners with fish: for
this reason the attendance of costers&#8217; barrows at Billingsgate on a Friday
morning is always very great. As soon as you reach the Monument you see a
line of them, with one or two tall fishmongers&#8217; carts breaking the
uniformity, and the din of the cries and commotion of the distant market
begin to break on the ear like the buzzing of a hornet&#8217;s nest. The whole
neighbourhood is covered with hand-barrows, some laden with baskets,
others with sacks. The air is filled with a kind of sea-weedy odour,
reminding one of the sea-shore; and on entering the market, the smell of
whelks, red herrings, sprats, and a hundred other sorts of fish, is almost
overpowering. The wooden barn looking square<a name='fna_14' id='fna_14' href='#f_14'><small>[14]</small></a> where the fish is sold
is, soon after six o&#8217;clock, crowded with shiny cord jackets and greasy
caps. Everybody comes to Billingsgate in his worst clothes; and no one
knows the length of time a coat can be worn until they have been to a fish
sale. Through the bright opening at the end are seen the tangled rigging
of the oyster boats, and the red-worsted caps of the sailors. Over the hum
of voices is heard the shouts of the salesmen, who, with their white
aprons, peering above the heads of the mob, stand on their tables roaring
out their prices. All are bawling together&mdash;salesmen and hucksters of
provisions, capes, hardware, and newspapers&mdash;till the place is a perfect
Babel of competition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>The sale of hot green peas in the streets of London is of great antiquity,
that is to say, if the cry of &#8220;<i>Hot peascods! one began to cry</i>,&#8221; recorded
by Lydgate in his <i>London Lackpenny</i>, may be taken as having intimated the
sale of the same article under the modern cry of &#8220;<i>Hot green peas! all
hot, all hot! Here&#8217;s your peas, hot, hot, hot!</i>&#8221; In many parts of the
country it is, or was, customary to have a &#8220;<i>scalding of peas</i>,&#8221; as a sort
of rustic festivity, at which green peas scalded or slightly boiled with
their pods on are the main dish. Being set on the table in the midst of
the party, each person dips his peapod in a common cup of melted butter,
seasoned with salt and pepper, and extracts the peas by the agency of his
teeth. At times one bean, shell and all is put into the steaming mass,
whoever gets this bean is to be first married.</p>

<p>The sellers of green peas &#8220;hot, all hot!&#8221; have no stands but carry them in
a tin pot or pan which is wrapped round with a thick cloth, to retain the
heat. The peas are served out with a ladle, and eaten by the customers out
of basins provided with spoons by the vendor. Salt and pepper are supplied
<i>at discretion</i>, but the <i>fresh!</i> butter to grease &#8217;em (<i>avec votre
permission</i>.)</p>

<p>The hot green peas are sold out in halfpennyworths and pennyworths, some
vendors, in addition to the usual seasoning supplied, add <i>a suck of
bacon</i>. The &#8220;suck of bacon&#8221; is obtained by the street Arabs from a piece
of that article, securely fastened by a string, to obtain a &#8220;relish&#8221; for
the peas, or as is usually said &#8220;to flavour &#8217;em;&#8221; sometimes these young
gamins manage to bite the string and then <i>bolt</i> not only the bacon, but
away from the vendors. The popular saying &#8220;a plate of veal cut with a
<i>hammy</i> knife&#8221; is but a refined rendering of the pea and suck-&#8217;o-bacon,
street luxury trick.</p>

<p>Pea soup is also sold in the streets of London, but not to the extent it
was twenty years ago, when the chilled labourer and others having only a
halfpenny to spend would indulge in a basin of&mdash;&#8220;<i>All hot!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The history of the happy and social walnut involves some curious
misconceptions. Take its name to begin with. Why walnut? What has this
splendid, wide-spreading tree to do with walls, except such as are used as
stepping-stones for the boys to climb up into the branches and steal the
fruit? Nothing whatever! for, if we are to believe the learned in such
matters, this fine old English tree, as it is sometimes called, is not an
English tree at all, but a distinct and emphatic foreigner, and hence the
derivation. The walnut is a native of Persia, and has been so named to
distinguish the naturalised European from its companions, the hazel, the
filbert, and the chesnut. In &#8220;the authorities&#8221; we are told that &#8220;gual&#8221; or
&#8220;wall&#8221; means &#8220;strange&#8221; or &#8220;exotic,&#8221; the same root being found in Welsh
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> kindred tongues; hence walnut. It is true, at any rate, that in
France they retain the distinctive name &#8220;Noix Persique.&#8221; There is another
mistaken theory connected with the tree which bears a fruit so dear to
society at large, for someone has been hazardous enough to assert that:&mdash;</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But I sadly miss the cry</span><br />
That told in the night when the stars were bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or the rain-cloud veiled the sky.</span><br />
Watchmen, Watchmen, ye are among<br />
The bygone things that will haunt me long.<br />

&#8220;Three bunches a penny, Primroses!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, dear is the greeting of Spring;</span><br />
When she offers her dew-spangled posies;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest Creation can bring.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Three bunches a penny, Primroses!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The echo resounds in the mart;</span><br />
And the simple &#8220;cry&#8221; often uncloses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The worldly bars grating man&#8217;s heart.</span><br />
<br />
We reflect, we contrive, and we reckon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How best we can gather up wealth;</span><br />
We go where bright finger-posts beckon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till we wander from Nature and Health.</span><br />
<br />
But the &#8220;old cry,&#8221; shall burst on our scheming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The song of &#8220;Primroses&#8221; shall flow,</span><br />
And &#8220;Three bunches a penny&#8221; set dreaming<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all that we loved long ago.</span><br />
<br />
It brings visions of meadow and mountain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of valley, and streamlet, and hill,</span><br />
When Life&#8217;s ocean but played in a fountain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah, would that it sparkled so still!</span><br />
<br />
It conjures back shadowless hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When we threaded the dark, forest ways;</span><br />
When our own hand went seeking the flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our own lips were shouting their praise.</span><br />
<br />
The perfume and tint of the blossom;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are as fresh in vale, dingle, and glen;</span><br />
But say, is the pulse of our bosom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As warm and as bounding as then?</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Three bunches a penny,&mdash;Primroses!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Three bunches a penny,&mdash;come, buy!&#8221;</span><br />
A blessing on all the sweet posies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And good-will to the poor ones who cry.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Lavender, sweet Lavender!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With &#8220;Cherry Ripe!&#8221; is coming;</span><br />
While the droning beetles whirr,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And merry bees are humming.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span><br />
&#8220;Lavender, sweet Lavender!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, pleasant is the crying;</span><br />
While the rose-leaves scarcely stir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And downy moths are flying,</span><br />
<br />
Oh, dearly do I love &#8220;Old Cries,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your &#8220;Lilies all a-blowing!&#8221;</span><br />
Your blossoms blue, still wet with dew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Sweet Violets all a-growing!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
Oh, happy were the days, methinks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In truth the best of any;</span><br />
When &#8220;Periwinkles, winkle, winks!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Allured my last, lone penny.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, what had I to do with cares<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bring the frown and furrow,</span><br />
When &#8220;Walnuts&#8221; and &#8220;Fine mellow Pears&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beat Catalani thorough.</span><br />
<br />
Full dearly do I love &#8220;Old Cries,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And always turn to hear them;</span><br />
And though they cause me some few sighs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those sighs do but endear them.</span><br />
<br />
My heart is like the fair sea-shell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There&#8217;s music ever in it;</span><br />
Though bleak the shore where it may dwell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some power still lives to win it.</span><br />
<br />
When music fills the shell no more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8217;Twill be all crushed and scattered;</span><br />
And when this heart&#8217;s deep tone is o&#8217;er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8217;Twill be all cold and shattered.</span><br />
<br />
Oh, vain will be the hope to break<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its last and dreamless slumbers;</span><br />
When &#8220;Old Cries&#8221; come, and fail to wake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its deep and fairy numbers!</span></td></tr></table>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The London Street-Markets on a Saturday Night.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Henry Mayhew has painted a minute yet vivid picture of the London
street markets, street sellers and purchasers which are to be seen in the
greatest number on a Saturday night:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, and in the streets immediately adjoining, the working classes
generally purchase their Sunday&#8217;s dinner; and after pay-time on Saturday
night, or early on Sunday morning, the crowd in the New-cut, and the Brill
in particular, is almost impassable. Indeed, the scene in these parts has
more the character of a fair than a market. There are hundreds of stalls,
and every stall has its one or two lights; either it is illuminated by the
intense white light of the new self-generating gas-lamp, or else it is
brightened up by the red smoky flame of the old-fashioned grease-lamp. One
man shows off his yellow haddock with a candle stuck in a bundle of
firewood; his neighbour makes a candlestick of a huge turnip, and the
tallow gutters over its sides; whilst the boy shouting &#8220;Eight a penny,
stunning pears!&#8221; has rolled his dip in a thick coat of brown paper, that
flares away with the candle. Some stalls are crimson with the fire shining
through the holes beneath the baked chesnut stove; others have handsome
octohedral lamps, while a few have a candle shining through a sieve;
these, with the sparkling ground-glass globes of the tea-dealers&#8217; shops,
and the butchers&#8217; gaslights streaming and fluttering in the wind, like
flags of flame, pour forth such a flood of light, that at a distance the
atmosphere immediately above the spot is as lurid as if the street were on fire.</p>


<p>&nbsp;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img252.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Street-Market On Saturday Night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>The pavement and the road are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers.
The housewife in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, walks
slowly on, stopping now to look at the stall of caps, and now to cheapen a
bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hands,
creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice,
and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the
tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting
at the top of their voices, at one and the same time, is almost
bewildering. &#8220;So-old again,&#8221; roars one. &#8220;Chesnuts, all&#8217;ot, a penny a
score,&#8221; bawls another. &#8220;An &#8217;aypenny a skin, blacking,&#8221; squeaks a boy.
&#8220;Buy, buy, buy, buy,&mdash;bu-u-uy!&#8221; cries the butcher. &#8220;Half-quire of paper
for a penny,&#8221; bellows the street-stationer. &#8220;An &#8217;apenny a lot ing-uns.&#8221;
&#8220;Twopence a pound, grapes.&#8221; &#8220;Three a penny! Yarmouth bloaters.&#8221; &#8220;Who&#8217;ll
buy a bonnet for fourpence?&#8221; &#8220;Pick &#8217;em out cheap here! three pair for
a-halfpenny, bootlaces.&#8221; &#8220;Now&#8217;s your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a
lot.&#8221; &#8220;Here&#8217;s ha&#8217;p&#8217;orths,&#8221; shouts the perambulating confectioner. &#8220;Come
and look at&#8217;em! here&#8217;s toasters!&#8221; bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater
stuck on a toasting fork. &#8220;Penny a lot, fine russets,&#8221; calls the apple
woman: and so the Babel goes on.</p>

<p>One man stands with his red-edge mats hanging over his back and chest,
like a herald&#8217;s coat; and the girl with her basket of walnuts lifts her
brown-stained fingers to her mouth, as she screams, &#8220;Fine warnuts! sixteen
a penny, fine war-r-nuts.&#8221; A bootmaker, to &#8220;ensure custom,&#8221; has
illuminated his front-shop with a line of gas, and in its full glare
stands a blind beggar, his eyes turned up so as to show only &#8220;the whites,&#8221;
and mumbling some begging rhymes, that are drowned in the shrill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span> notes of
the bamboo-flute-player next to him. The boy&#8217;s sharp cry, the woman&#8217;s
cracked voice, the gruff, hoarse shout of the man, are all mingled
together. Sometimes an Irishman is heard with his &#8220;fine ating apples,&#8221; or
else the jingling music of an unseen organ breaks out, as the trio of
street singers rest between the verses.</p>

<p>Then the sights, as you elbow your way through the crowd are equally
multifarious. Here is a stall glittering with new tin saucepans; there
another, bright with its blue and yellow crockery, and sparkling with
white glass. Now you come to a row of old shoes arranged along the
pavement; now to a stand of gaudy tea-trays; then to a shop with red
handkerchiefs and blue checked shirts, fluttering backwards and forwards,
and a counter built up outside on the kerb, behind which are boys
beseeching custom. At the door of a tea-shop, with its hundred white
globes of light, stands a man delivering bills, thanking the public for
past favours, and &#8220;defying competition.&#8221; Here, along side the road, are
some half-dozen headless tailors&#8217; dummies, dressed in Chesterfields and
fustian jackets, each labelled:&mdash;&#8220;Look at the prices,&#8221; or &#8220;Observe the
quality.&#8221; After this a butcher&#8217;s shop, crimson and white with meat piled
up to the first-floor, in front of all the butcher himself, in his blue
coat, walks up and down, sharpening his knife on the steel that hangs to
his waist. A little further on stands the clean family, begging; the
father with his head down as if in shame, and a box of lucifers held forth
in his hand&mdash;the boys in newly-washed pinafores, and the tidyly got up
mother with a child at her breast. This stall is green and white with
bunches of turnips&mdash;that red with apples, the next yellow with onions, and
another purple with pickling cabbages. One minute you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> pass a man with an
umbrella turned inside up and full of prints; the next, you hear one with
a peepshow of Mazeppa, and Paul Jones the pirate, describing the pictures
to the boys looking in at the little round windows. Then is heard the
sharp snap of the purcussion-cap from the crowd of lads firing at the
target for nuts; and the moment afterwards, you see either a black man
half-clad in white, and shivering in the cold with tracts in his hand, or
else you hear the sounds of music from &#8220;Frazier&#8217;s Circus,&#8221; on the other
side of the road, and the man outside the door of the penny concert,
beseeching you to &#8220;Be in time&mdash;be in time!&#8221; as Mr. Somebody is just about
to sing his favourite song of the &#8220;Knife Grinder.&#8221; Such, indeed, is the
riot, the struggle, and the scramble for a living, that the confusion and
the uproar of the New-cut on Saturday night have a bewildering and sad
effect upon the thoughtful mind.</p>

<p>Each salesman tries his utmost to sell his wares, tempting the passers-by
with his bargains. The boy with his stock of herbs offers &#8220;a double
&#8217;andful of fine parsley for a penny;&#8221; the man with the donkey-cart filled
with turnips has three lads to shout for him to their utmost, with their
&#8220;Ho! ho! hi-i-i! What do you think of us here? A penny a bunch&mdash;hurrah for
free trade! <i>Here&#8217;s</i> your turnips!&#8221; Until it is seen and heard, we have no
sense of the scramble that is going on throughout London for a living. The
same scene takes place at the Brill&mdash;the same in Leather-lane&mdash;the same in
Tottenham-court-road&mdash;the same in Whitecross-street; go to whatever corner
of the metropolis you please, either on a Saturday night or a Sunday
morning, and there is the same shouting and the same struggling to get the
penny profit out of the poor man&#8217;s Sunday&#8217;s dinner.</p>

<p>Since the above description was written, the New Cut has lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span> much of its
noisy and brilliant glory. In consequence of a New Police regulation,
&#8220;stands&#8221; or &#8220;pitches&#8221; have been forbidden, and each coster, on a market
night, is now obliged, under pain of the lock-up house, to carry his tray,
or keep moving with his barrow. The gay stalls have been replaced by deal
boards, some sodden with wet fish, others stained purple with
blackberries, or brown with walnut peel; and the bright lamps are almost
totally superseded by the dim, guttering candle. Even if the pole under
the tray or &#8220;shallow&#8221; is seen resting on the ground, the policeman on duty
is obliged to interfere.</p>

<p>The mob of purchasers has diminished one-half; and instead of the road
being filled with customers and trucks, the pavement and kerbstones are
scarcely crowded.</p>


<p class="center"><br /><span class="smcap">The Sunday Morning Markets.</span></p>

<p>Nearly every poor man&#8217;s market does its Sunday trade. For a few hours on
the Sabbath morning, the noise, bustle, and scramble of the Saturday night
are repeated, and but for this opportunity many a poor family would pass a
dinnerless Sunday. The system of paying the mechanic late on the Saturday
night&mdash;and more particularly of paying a man his wages in a
public-house&mdash;when he is tired with his day&#8217;s work, lures him to the
tavern, and there the hours fly quickly enough beside the warm tap-room
fire, so that by the time the wife comes for her husband&#8217;s wages, she
finds a large portion of them gone in drink and the streets half cleared,
thus the Sunday market is the only chance of getting the Sunday&#8217;s dinner.</p>

<p>Of all these Sunday morning markets, the Brill, perhaps, furnishes the
busiest scene; so that it may be taken as a type of the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>The streets in the neighbourhood are quiet and empty. The shops are closed
with their different coloured shutters, and the people round about are
dressed in the shiny cloth of the holiday suit. There are no &#8220;cabs,&#8221; and
but few omnibuses to disturb the rest, and men walk in the road as safely
as on the footpath.</p>

<p>As you enter the Brill the market sounds are scarcely heard. But at each
step the low hum grows gradually into the noisy shouting, until at last
the different cries become distinct, and the hubbub, din, and confusion of
a thousand voices bellowing at once, again fill the air. The road and
footpath are crowded, as on the over-night; the men are standing in
groups, smoking and talking; whilst the women run to and fro, some with
the white round turnips showing out of their filled aprons, others with
cabbages under their arms, and a piece of red meat dangling from their
hands. Only a few of the shops are closed; but the butcher&#8217;s and the coal
shed are filled with customers, and from the door of the shut-up baker&#8217;s,
the women come streaming forth with bags of flour in their hands, while
men sally from the halfpenny barber&#8217;s, smoothing their clean-shaved chins.
Walnuts, blacking, apples, onions, braces, combs, turnips, herrings, pens,
and corn-plasters, are all bellowed out at the same time. Labourers and
mechanics, still unshorn and undressed, hang about with their hands in
their pockets, some with their pet terriers under their arms. The pavement
is green with the refuse leaves of vegetables, and round a cabbage-barrow
the women stand turning over the bunches, as the man shouts &#8220;Where you
like, only a penny.&#8221; Boys are running home with the breakfast herring held
in a piece of paper, and the side-pocket of an apple man&#8217;s stuff coat
hangs down with the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> of halfpence stored within it. Presently the
tolling of the neighbouring church bells break forth. Then the bustle
doubles itself, the cries grow louder, the confusion greater. Women run
about and push their way through the throng, scolding the saunterers, for
in half-an-hour the market will close. In a little time the butcher puts
up his shutters, and leaves the door still open; the policemen in their
clean gloves come round and drive the street-sellers before them, and as
the clock strikes eleven the market finishes, and the Sunday&#8217;s rest
begins.&#8221;</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/img253.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As it was in the beginning of our book and in the days of Queen
Elizabeth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When the City shopkeepers railed against itinerant traders of every
denomination, and the Common Council declared that in ancient times
the open streets and lanes had been used, and ought to be used only,
as the common highway, and not for the hucksters, pedlars, and
hagglers, to stand and sell their wares in&#8221;&mdash;</p></div>

<p>so it is now, in the Victorian age, and ever will be a very vexed
question, and thinking representative men of varied social positions
materially differ in opinion; some contending that the question is not of
class interest but that of the interest of the public at large; some argue
in an effective but perfectly legal and orderly manner for the removal of
what they term a greivous nuisance; others ask that an industrious and
useful class of men and women should be allowed their honest calling. They
protest against the enforcement of an almost obsolete statute which
conduces to the waste of fruit, fish, and vegetables, in London and large
towns, which practically maintains a trade monopoly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> discourages an
abundant supply. They claim for the public a right to buy in the cheapest
market, and plead for a liberty which is enjoyed unmolested in many parts
of the kingdom, and protest against a remnant of protectionist restriction
being put into force against street-hawking.</p>

<p>By the side of this temperate reasoning, let us place the principal
arguments which are so often reiterated by aldermen, deputies,
councillors, vestrymen, and others, when &#8220;drest in a little brief
authority,&#8221; and come at once to the <i>gravamen</i> of the charge against the
hawkers, which we find to consist in the nuisance of the street cries.</p>

<p>London, as a commercial city, has numbers of visitors and residents to
whom quiet is of vital importance. The street cries, it is alleged,
constitute a nuisance to the public, particularly to numbers of
day-time-alone occupants, to whom time and thought is money. It is the
same thing repeated with many of the suburban residents, in what is
generally known as quiet neighbourhoods. Discounting duly the rhetorical
exaggeration, it is to be feared the charge must be admitted. Therefore,
the shopkeepers argue, let us put down the hawking of everything and
everybody. But this does not follow at all. Not only so, but the proposed
remedy is ridiculously inadequate to the occasion. Admit the principle,
however, for the sake of argument and let us see whither it will lead us.
At early morn how often are our matutinal slumbers disturbed by a
prolonged shriek, as of some unfortunate cat in mortal agony, but which
simply signifies that Mr. Skyblue, the milkman, is on his rounds. The
milkman, it is evident, must be abolished. People can easily get their
breakfast milk at any respectable dairyman&#8217;s shop, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span> get it, too, with
less danger of an aqueous dilution. After breakfast&mdash;to say nothing of
German bands and itinerant organ grinders&mdash;a gentleman with a barrow
wakens the echoes by the announcement of fresh mackerel, salmon, cod,
whiting, soles or plaice, with various additional epithets, descriptive of
their recent arrival from the sea. The voice is more loud than melodious,
the repetition is frequent, and the effect is the reverse of pleasing to
the public ear. Accordingly we must abolish fish hawking: any respectable
fishmonger will supply us with better fish without making so much noise
over it; and if he charges a higher price it is only the indubitable right
of a respectable tradesman and a ratepayer. Then comes on the scene, and
determined to have a voice&mdash;and a loud one, too, in the morning&#8217;s
hullabaloo, the costermonger&mdash;Bill Smith, he declares with stentorian
lungs that his cherries, plums, apples, pears, turnips, carrots, cabbages,
<i>cow</i>cumbers, <i>sparrow</i>-grass, <i>colly</i>-flow-ers, <i>inguns</i>, <i>ru-bub</i>, and
<i>taters</i>, is, and allus vos rounder, sounder, longer, stronger, heavier,
fresher, and ever-so-much cheaper than any shopkeeping greengrocer as ever
vos: Why? &#8220;Vy? cos he don&#8217;t keep not no slap-up shop vith all plate-glass
vinders and a &#8217;andsom sixty-five guinea &#8217;oss and trap to take the missus
and the kids out on-a-arternoon, nor yet send his sons and darters to a
boarding school to larn French, German, Greek, nor playing on the
pianoforte.&#8221; All this may be very true; but Bill Smith, the costermonger,
is a noisy vulgar fellow; therefore must be put down. Mrs. Curate, Mrs.
Lawyer, Mrs. Chemist, and Miss Seventy-four must be taught to go to the
greengrocer of the district, Mr. Manners, a highly respectable man, a
Vestryman and a Churchwarden, who keeps:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Plate, Waiters, and Linen for Hire.<br />
N.B.&mdash;Evening Parties Attended.</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>As the morning wears on we have:&mdash;&#8220;I say!&mdash;I say!!
Old hats I buy,&#8221; &#8220;Rags or bones,&#8221; &#8220;Hearthstones,&#8221; &#8220;Scissors to grind&mdash;pots, pans, kettles or old
umbrellas to mend,&#8221; &#8220;Old clo! clo,&#8221; &#8220;Cat or dog&#8217;s meat,&#8221; &#8220;Old china I
mend,&#8221; &#8220;Clothes props,&#8221; &#8220;Any old chairs to mend?&#8221; &#8220;Any ornaments for your
fire stove,&#8221; &#8220;Ripe strawberries,&#8221; &#8220;Any hare skins,&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;rabbit skins,&#8221; &#8220;Pots
or pans&mdash;jugs or mugs,&#8221; &#8220;I say, Bow! wow! and they are all a-growing and
a-blowing&mdash;three pots for sixpence,&#8221; and other regular acquaintances, with
the occasional accompaniment of the dustman&#8217;s bell, conclude the morning&#8217;s
performance, which, altogether is reminiscent of the &#8220;Market Chorus&#8221; in
the opera of <i>Masaniello</i>; and if the public quiet is to be protected, our
sapient Town Councillors would abolish one and all of these, dustman
included. One of the latest innovations upon the peace and happiness of an
invalid, an author, or a quiet-loving resident, is the street vendor of
coals. &#8220;Tyne Main,&#8221; or &#8220;Blow-me-Tight&#8217;s,&#8221; Coals! &#8220;C-o-a-l-s, <i>one and
tuppence a underd&mdash;see&#8217;em weighed</i>.&#8221; This is the New Cry. Small waggons,
attended by a man and a boy, go to our modern railway sidings to be filled
or replenished with sacks containing 56 lbs. or 112 lbs. of coals, and
then proceed to the different suburban quiet neighbourhoods, where the man
and boy commence a kind of one done the other go on duet to the above
words, which is enough to drive the strongest trained one crazy. All the
great coal merchants seem to have adopted this method of retailing coals,
and have thus caused the almost total abolition of coal sheds, and the
greengrocer and general dealer to abandon the latter part of his calling.
Our afternoon hours, after the passing of the muffin bell, are made
harmonious by public references to shrimps, fine Yarmouth bloaters,
haddocks, periwinkles, boiled whelks, and water<i>creases</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> which are too
familiar to need description; and our local governors in their wisdom
would bid us no longer be luxurious at our tea, or else go to respectable
shops and buy our &#8220;little creature comforts.&#8221; Professing an anxiety to put
down street cries, our police persecute one class out of a multitude, and
leave all the rest untouched. It is not only an inadequate remedy, but the
remedy is sought in the wrong direction. The fact is, that the street
noises are an undoubted evil, and in the interests of the public, action
should be taken not to put them down, but to regulate them by local
bye-laws, leaving the course of trade otherwise free. It is a plan adopted
in most of the greater towns which have in any way dealt with the subject.</p>

<p><a name='f_1' id='f_1' href='#fna_1'>[1]</a> &#8220;The England of Shakespeare,&#8221; by E. Goadby&mdash;Cassell, Petter, Galpin &amp;
Co., London, E.C.</p>

<p><a name='f_2' id='f_2' href='#fna_2'>[2]</a> For the use of the woodcut blocks representing the &#8220;Smith Arms,&#8221; and
the Globe Theatre, we are indebted to our friend Mr. John W. Jarvis,
author of &#8220;Musee-Phusee-Glyptic: A Scrap Book of Jottings from
Stratford-on-Avon, and Elsewhere,&#8221; London, 1875, who introduces them into
the pages of his work thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Not long since, after a pleasing and interesting walk, one fine
morning on Bankside, and standing near the still existing Cardinal Cap
Alley, with the aid of an artist friend, we drew up a fancy picture of
what Bankside was in Shakespeare&#8217;s day.&mdash;Here a small creek with craft
and busy life around; a small bridge, with road leading to the Globe,
the famous theatre afterwards to be so widely known. The sunshiny time
of our literature and life, making a red-letter period in happy old
England&#8217;s history. We were interrupted by a kindly-faced,
round-shouldered man of the bargee type, who asked us &#8216;if it was
Shakespeare, him as writ plays, we was a torkin&#8217; on; if so be it were,
he could show us the wery &#8217;ouse he used, least ways, all as is left on
it.&#8217; After a twisting tramp through Cardinal Cap Alley, we were
brought out opposite the public-house known by the name of the &#8216;Smith
Arms,&#8217; which had just then only escaped entire demolition from fire by
a very near chance&mdash;(the damage done has since necessitated the
rebuilding; so the sketch stands as a bit of rescued old London.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Our informant assured us that&mdash;&#8216;Shakespeare as had a playus nigh
there, used to use that wery &#8217;ouse; him as writ the Merchant of
Venice, Money, and the Forest of Bondy.&#8217; Our kind friend was
interrupted by a companion, who said, &#8216;Not Bondy: him didn&#8217;t write
that.&#8217; &#8216;I won&#8217;t give up Money, because the Merchant of Venice is all
about Money. You better say he didn&#8217;t write Richard the Third and
Richard the Fourth.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We gladly retired before our historic doubts were confirmed by this
traditional scholar, about this double Gloucester. His companion, as
we thought rather aptly, but churlishly remarked, &#8216;cheese it,&#8217; for
they were both getting grumpy, and after this duplicate, we were
fearful a fifth or a sixth might appear. But the house itself, one
among the oldest in Southwark, we considered worthy a sketch, and, as
our guide told us, ought to be &#8216;<i>perpetrated</i>.&#8217; He said he could pull
a bit, but draw he couldn&#8217;t; but he did&mdash;that is, four-pence for
beer.&#8221;</p></div>

treatment of pedlars and hawkers, to compel them and those with whom they
dealt to fulfil their contracts. This court arose from the necessity of
doing justice expeditiously, among persons resorting from distant places
to a fair or market. It is said to be called the court of <i>pie-poudre,
curia, pedis pulverizate</i>, from the dusty feet of the suitors, or, as Sir
Edward Coke says, because justice is there done as speedily as dust can
fall from the feet.</p>

<p><a name='f_7' id='f_7' href='#fna_7'>[7]</a> The Curtain Road, now notorious for cheap and shoddy furniture, still
marks the site of the Curtain Theatre; at the same date there was another
playhouse in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch, distinguished as &#8220;The
Theatre,&#8221; where the Chamberlain&#8217;s Company had settled. John Stow, in his
Survey of London, 1598, speaking of the priory of St. John Baptist, says:
&#8220;And neere thereunto are builded two publique houses for acting of shews
of comedies, tragedies, and histories, for recreation. Whereof is one
called the &#8220;Courtein,&#8221; the other &#8220;The Theatre;&#8221; both standing on the South
West side toward the field.&#8221; In both these James Burbadge may have been
interested; his long residence in the parish may fairly lead to the
conclusion, that he was a sharer in at least one of them. Richard Tarlton,
the famous actor of clown&#8217;s parts, was a near neighbour of James Burbadge,
and a shareholder and performer at the Curtain. Thomas Pope, a performer
of rustic clowns, by his will dated July, 1603, left&mdash;&#8220;All my part, right,
title, and interest which I have in the playhouse, called the Curtein,
situated and being in Halliwell, in the parish of St. Leonard&#8217;s in
Shoreditch, in the County of Middlesex.&#8221; At what date one or the other of
these early Suburban playhouses ceased to be occupied, we have little or
no satisfactory evidence.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
